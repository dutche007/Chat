Our many and varied lived experiences of emergencies with eating  di",
    "sorders demonstrate the importance of managing them well – this can, and  does, save lives like ours.  \r\nBut that does not mean this subject is without difficulty, despite everyone’s best  efforts. These guidelines are to simply heighten awareness around the treatment  of a person with an eating disorder and hopefully broaden knowledge on how  best to deal with someone who presents with signs of an eating disorder. From  spotting eating disorders and signs of emergencies when they may not be  ob",
    "viously present, to supporting patients who may be frightened at the prospect  of receiving any intervention – there are many challenges in an emergency which  are faced by clinicians, patients and families alike. The provision and acceptability  of good care is therefore a shared endeavour, and so the human and relational  basis of healthcare should never be forgotten. Even in a crisis, understanding how  we feel and creating an alliance when you talk to us, can remove barriers to  lifesaving c",
    "are. \r\nThe clinical need for guidance on recognising and managing emergencies arising  from eating disorders, across presentations and populations, is without question.  The demand for knowledge among healthcare professionals is also evident. There  is nothing worse than feeling ill-equipped in the face of an emergency when, in  fact, there is much that can be done using this guidance as a base.  \r\nAs patients and carers, we need clinicians to be proactive in considering eating  disorders in the",
    " first place, thus reducing the chances of a situation becoming an  emergency. They must then be equipped with the knowledge and skills to  manage emergencies wherever and however they show up in healthcare  systems. We hope these guidelines can contribute to a cultural shift whereby  healthcare professionals no longer see eating disorder emergencies as the sole  responsibility of specialist workforces. Eating disorders are everyone’s business. \r\nMost of all, these guidelines need to be shared a",
    "nd used. As beneficiaries of  lifesaving care, we are indebted to those who have helped manage our  emergencies effectively. Because of this care, we have a voice in these guidelines  when so many can tragically no longer be heard. Deaths from eating disorders  result from a lack of care, and can be prevented. \r\nJames Downs, Patient Representative, and Ben Robinson, Patient Representative\r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 11 \r\n2: College an",
    "d NHSE perspective \r\nWe are very pleased to see the launch of this exceptionally timely and important  report addressing the management of medical emergencies in eating disorders.  Alongside welcome investment in and development of services for people with  eating disorders, the past few years have seen eating disorders spotlighted  through untimely deaths of young people with anorexia nervosa. Failings were  found in the care that each of these young people received, across all sectors of  heal",
    "thcare. Eating disorders are common, and through the COVID-19 pandemic  we have seen an unprecedented increase in clinical presentations of people with  severe eating disorders warranting urgent care across healthcare settings. The  skills to recognise and manage eating disorders when they become a medical  emergency are a necessity. \r\nWe are particularly pleased to see this report published with endorsement from  the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, as the findings have relevance for  clinici",
    "ans from many professional backgrounds. The team behind the report  reflects the intended multi-professional readership, with an authorship and  editorial team spanning the breadth of clinical expertise likely to encounter  patients with eating disorders, working alongside patients and carers with lived  experience of severe eating disorders, all underpinned by the well-established  processes of the NCCMH for rigorous scientific review and achieving professional  consensus. \r\nA key objective of ",
    "this report is for all clinicians likely to encounter such patients,  from primary through to intensive care to have practical tools at their fingertips  to guide care in an emergency. Perhaps more importantly however, the report  highlights the need for all services to be prepared for such emergencies and to  anticipate the challenges our health care structures can create for people with  simultaneous mental and physical health care needs. Commissioners and  managers are as much the intended au",
    "dience for this report as clinicians  themselves. \r\nThe challenge for all reports is to make sure they result in better care. The NHS,  General Medical Council and Academy of Medical Royal Colleges are already  deeply embedded in development of training, clinical audit and quality  improvement initiatives to improve the care of patients with eating disorders. The  contents of this report form the basis of a core element of that work, namely  competence in management of medical emergencies in eat",
    "ing disorders, across  all ages, all types of eating disorders and all health care settings. Our hope is that  all the stakeholder organisations involved its development will also support  dissemination of its contents.  \r\nDr Adrian James, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists \r\nand Professor Tim Kendall, National Clinical Director for Mental Health, NHS England\r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 12 \r\nExecutive summary and  \r\nrecom",
    "mendations  \r\nEating disorders are common and affect people irrespective of age,  ethnicity, social class and geography. They can arise in all settings, from  major cities to remote and rural areas, including locations that do not  have formal eating disorder services (EDSs). During the COVID-19  pandemic, many people found they could carry out their work remotely,  including delivery of many types of mental health care. This approach  may have helped people who live in places with little access",
    " to  specialised treatment,1 but remote consultation restricts physical  monitoring and presents challenges compared with in-person  treatment.2,3,4 Referrals to children and young people’s community EDSs  in England increased significantly during the pandemic, and paediatricians reported large increases in admissions of young people  with restrictive eating disorders,5 reflecting increased acuity of cases.  National data for adults are not so readily available, but what data there  are tell a s",
    "imilar story.6 This paints an alarming picture in which all  clinicians are increasingly likely to encounter patients with eating  disorders in their daily practice.  \r\nThe aim of this guidance is to make preventable deaths due to eating  disorders a thing of the past. It is not a comprehensive textbook on eating  disorders; rather, it addresses eating disorder presentations likely to lead  the patient to an emergency department or a medical/paediatric ward. The emphasis is on medical management",

The working group that produced this guidance is the  fourth group to address these issues, which succeeds the Management of  Really Sick Patients with Anorexia Nervosa (MARSIPAN) and Junior  MARSIPAN guidance.  \r\nThe project first arose out of concerns that patients with severe anorexia  nervosa7 were being admitted to general medical units and, in some  cases, deteriorating and dying.

    "oduction \r\na. History of the project  \r\nThis project began in 2008 when the  very tragic case of a young woman  with anorexia nervosa, who died in a  medical ward, was presented at an  annual British Association for  \r\nParenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN) conference. It was clear that  the medical team involved did not  have the close support of eating  disorder specialists. Following the  presentation at the conference, a  psychiatrist (Paul Robinson) and a  physician (Tim Bowling) met and ",
    " decided to try and improve that  unsatisfactory situation. A large  number of physicians and \r\npsychiatrists, and a smaller number of  other people including a GP,  \r\na pharmacist, dietitians, a psychologist,  self-help professionals and carers, were  then invited to collaborate in the  production of the first guidance in  2010. A revision of the adult version  was published in 2014. A separate  ‘Junior’ version of the guidance (led by  Dasha Nicholls) was successful in its  aim of reaching and",
    " engaging  paediatricians in the care of children  and adolescents11 with eating disorders  in acute settings.  \r\nb. What has happened  since? \r\ni. Has the guidance been  taken up? \r\nIn 2018, a national survey of MARSIPAN guidance utilisation by professionals  (see Annexe 2) was sent to 562  clinicians across the UK, of which  214 (38%) responded. The aim was to  assess awareness among non-eating  disorder specialists in acute hospital  settings. The response rate for \r\nCR233: Medical Emergencie",
    "s in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 19   \r\n1. Introduction \r\nprofessional groups differed: adult physician/gastroenterologists 23%, paediatricians  37%, adult EDS clinicians 56%, and CAMHS eating disorder clinicians 65%. Of the  clinicians who responded, 92.5% (n=198) had heard of MARSIPAN and 96.5% (n=192)  used Junior or Adult MARSIPAN guidance in their workplace.  \r\nThe guidance has reached academic and public awareness in the UK and beyond,  including reference in",
    " the NICE guideline on eating disorders.12 A book, Critical Care  for Anorexia Nervosa, co-edited by Robinson and Nicholls, was published in 201513 and  had over 11,000 chapter downloads by November 2021.  \r\nA Junior MARSIPAN app for Android and iOS14 has been widely used among clinicians.  An all-age app is being developed to accompany this edition of the guidance.  \r\nii. Is there evidence that problems continue? \r\nIn 2017, the Parliamentary Health Services Ombudsman (PHSO) produced a hard hitt",
    "ing report entitled ‘Ignoring the alarms: How NHS EDSs are failing patients’.15 In  the PHSO report, three tragic cases are reviewed. One of these is that of 19-year-old  Averil Hart. Averil developed anorexia nervosa, for which she was treated as an  inpatient in a specialist eating disorders service. After discharge in 2012, she went to  university, which she had been very keen to do. In Averil’s first term, her anorexia  nervosa worsened and she was treated in a local eating disorders service",
    ". Sadly, she  continued to deteriorate and lose weight. She was discovered by her cleaner very  unwell, and an ambulance was called. Averil was admitted to a medical ward where  she continued to lose weight and she was transferred to another medical unit where  she died, having had severe hypoglycaemia.16 The Ombudsman’s comment was:  \r\nWe found that all the NHS organisations involved in Averil’s care  and treatment between her discharge from hospital on 2 August  2012 and her tragic death five ",
    "months later on 15 December  failed her in some way. We found her deterioration and death  were avoidable.”  \r\nThe PHSO recommended the following:  \r\nThe General Medical Council should conduct a review of training for all  junior doctors on eating disorders to improve understanding of these  complex mental health conditions  \r\nHealth Education England should review how its current education and  training can address the gaps in provision of eating disorder specialists.

They should also set out what their role  would be in circumstances where local NHS organisations are failing to  work together to establish what has happened and why, so that lessons  can be learnt.  \r\nA working group was established to address these recommendations, led by NHS  England and with participatio",
    "n of arm’s length bodies including the Royal College of  Psychiatrists, reporting to the PHSO.17 Meanwhile other coroner’s inquests into deaths  from anorexia nervosa have taken place, and headlines such as ‘Eating disorders:  12 deaths in seven years led to coroner warnings’18 continue to appear.  \r\nAnorexia nervosa is known to be a potentially fatal disease, with a high standardised  mortality ratio,19 particularly if comorbidity is present. Not all deaths are avoidable, but  our view is that ",
    "psychiatric and medical services for patients with eating disorders  must do more to improve the care that severely ill patients receive so that patients  such as Averil Hart can be successfully treated. We therefore strongly endorse all of  the PHSO’s recommendations, and with it the acknowledgement that all eating  disorders, not solely anorexia nervosa, can result in high, and often preventable,  mortality.  \r\niii. This revision \r\nThis updated version of the guidance is significantly differen",
    "t from previous versions,  having undergone a number of major changes with the purpose of improving its  clinical and scientific value, including reach of the guidance. The guidance is across  the age range and the evidence base for recommendations, when available, is clear.  Nonetheless, too many of the recommendations are based on expert opinion rather  than empirical research and further research is needed. \r\n17https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachm",

Introduction \r\n1. Contributors \r\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) commissioned the NCCMH20, based on  their experience of producin",
    "g NICE guidelines, to work with the team. The project  group comprised nine members: three clinicians (Dasha Nicholls, Chair; Paul  Robinson, Clinical Advisor; Agnes Ayton, Eating Disorders Faculty Chair) and six  NCCMH team members. An Expert Reference Group (ERG) was established,  comprising professional leads from among the guidance authorship and three patient  representatives/experts by experience. A consultation group with 34 further members mainly comprised clinicians, with two commission",
    "ers and the chief executive of Beat,  the UK eating disorder charity. Most members of the consultation group were  nominated by their professional organisation, and the experts by experience were  nominated by RCPsych. See the list of contributors for full details. \r\n2. Scope \r\nWhile anorexia nervosa was the main focus of MARSIPAN, , as prompted by the initial  cases, other eating disorders can also be very dangerous.  \r\nIn this updated guidance, more emphasis has been placed on the risks posed ",
    "by other  eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa (which results in an estimated 22 deaths  per year in the UK6), avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID, which carries  risks due to weight loss and nutritional deficiencies) and binge eating disorder (which  also has significant dangers, although data on mortality are sparse). There is also a  significant risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm in eating disorders, with one in five  deaths of people with anorexia nervosa being due t",
    "o suicide21, and very high rates of  self-harm and comorbid depression across eating disorder diagnoses, including  OSFED and UFED22 in which people have key symptoms of an eating disorder but do  not meet full diagnostic criteria, such as purging disorder. A supplement on eating  disorders and type 1 diabetes mellitus accompanies this guidance (see Annexe 3).  Scientific knowledge about the risks posed by dietary restriction when BMI is normal  or high is limited, although there are anecdotal a",
    "ccounts of, for example, severe  malnutrition that can develop after bariatric surgery for obesity.23 Moreover, serious  medical consequences can arise for people with ARFID who are within the normal  weight range24 as well as at low weight.  \r\nIn this guidance, discussion of feeding and eating disorders, including ARFID, will be  restricted to circumstances in which a medical emergency can be expected. We have  used the term ‘restrictive disorder’ to refer to anorexia nervosa and ARFID, as well",
    " as  some atypical eating disorders defined by the terms OSFED and UFED. In the absence  of research, risks in atypical eating disorders should be based on symptoms, such as  purging behaviour, low weight or self-harm. \r\n20 https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/improving-care/nccmh 21 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21727255/ \r\n22 OSFED Other Specific Feeding and Eating Disorders, UFED Unspecified feeding or Eating Disorder. 23 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23192683/ 24 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/315",

Introduction \r\nWho this guidance is aimed at?  \r\nThe guidance is primarily designed to support all clinicians likely to encounter  patients with severe eating disorders. But it also offers value to other professions and  groups, including:  \r\n❖ Medical doctors (including trainees): \r\n▪ general practitioners \r\n▪ emergency and acute physicians \r\n▪ paediatricians \r\n▪ psychiatrists (including \r",
    "\n❖ Allied healthcare professionals:  \r\n▪ emergency department staff  \r\n▪ dietitians \r\n▪ general and mental health nurses  \r\n▪ physiotherapists \r\n▪ psychologists and therapists \r\n❖ managers and commissioners coordinating care \r\n❖ people with eating disorders \r\n❖ relatives and carers of people with eating disorders.  \r\nAnnexe 1 contains a summary sheet of advice  \r\n\r\nfor each of these groups.  \r\nGuidance for all ages \r\nFor this revision, the decision was made to  combine the adult and child and ad",
    "olescent  versions into guidance for all ages, to reduce  confusion around transition ages and redress  potential disparities in approach. Each chapter  starts with issues that affect all ages, then issues  affecting under-18s mainly, and, lastly, issues  affecting over-18s mainly. In fact, most issues  affect all ages. The risk assessment framework  first developed in the Junior MARSIPAN guidance has been developed into an all-age  framework (Table 1).  \r\nMARSIPAN \r\nThe acronym MARSIPAN has bee",
    "n  dropped from the title following  feedback by patient and carer  groups, and to capture the  changed scope of medical risk for  all eating disorders, not only  anorexia nervosa. The focus on  medical emergencies is reflected  in the new title, Medical  \r\nEmergencies in Eating  \r\nDisorders: Guidance on  \r\nRecognition and Management. \r\n\r\nRather than a bibliography at the end of the document, hyperlinks to cited sources are provided in footnotes so that they can be accessed directly. \r\n3. Method",
    " \r\nDevelopment of this guidance was led from within the RCPsych Eating Disorders  Faculty. It included authors of the previous edition of the guidance and other  \r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 23   \r\n1. Introduction \r\nclinicians known to actively contribute to the field, representing the professional  groups most likely to encounter a patient in a medical setting.  \r\nThe authorship was divided into teams with a lead, each team drafting ",
    "a chapter.  Drafts were then reviewed by Paul Robinson and Dasha Nicholls for further editing  and combined into draft guidance. The resulting draft was then reviewed by the  NCCMH team and Agnes Ayton representing the Faculty of Eating Disorders prior to  circulation to the ERG. Comments and suggestions were either incorporated in the  draft or referred to the ERG for discussion. The guidance was then circulated to the  full authorship for comment, reviewed again by the project team, and matter",
    "s where  consensus was needed were taken to the ERG for discussion.  \r\nThe Royal College of Psychiatrists will review this guidance in 2025, to ensure it  remains current, as per their framework for guidelines. \r\nStakeholder consultation \r\nThe draft documents were circulated to stakeholder organisations that had been  identified by the authorship and those who registered interest in commenting on the  guidance. The public stakeholder consultation ran for 2 months from August to  October 2021. Co",
    "mments on the draft guidance and supporting documents were  received from stakeholder organisations, a list of which can be found in Appendix 1.  Stakeholder comments were reviewed by the project group, consulting the ERG  where necessary, and incorporated into the guidance as appropriate to produce the  final report. The stakeholder comments, and the project group’s responses to them  and list of associated actions, are available on the guidance web page. The documents  were amended based on th",
    "e consultation feedback and all comments were  responded to. The consultation process was based on that of NICE. \r\nForming the recommendations \r\nIn developing the guidance, the NCCMH used processes that they had previously used  for the development of NICE mental health clinical guidelines. Where possible,  recommendations (found in the Executive summary and recommendations) were based on the evidence that was reviewed. Where conclusive high-quality research  evidence was not available, informal",
    " consensus was used to develop  recommendations. Informal consensus was reached through discussion with the  Expert Reference Group, drawing on members expert knowledge and experience, and  incorporating the feedback from the stakeholder consultation. Where consensus was  not immediately possible, additional expertise was sought (for example, a cardiologist  was consulted regarding aspects of ECG findings). In all cases, additional information  enabled consensus to be reached. \r\nNCCMH involvemen",

Risk assessment: evaluating the impending risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\na. Introduction \r\nEating disorders can present with life-threatening emergencies often in the  emergency department,26 although such presentations are also seen in primar",
    "y care,  medical and paediatric wards, and mental health treatment settings. Most medical  problems arise from undernutrition and/or compensatory behaviours, such as  bingeing, purging, and other associated behaviours. Presentations may be triggered  by concerns from parents/carers, or from schools/universities or employers, and  adequate support must be given to those caring for people in non-medical settings.  \r\nIn primary care, in-person consultation may be necessary for patients presenting w",
    "ith  eating disorder symptoms in order to complete a risk assessment.  \r\nSee Appendix 3 for an eating disorder risk checklist for emergencies. i. Balancing risks  \r\nRisk assessment in eating disorders is multidimensional; the clinician must balance  risks in physical, psychological and social domains while paying attention to matters  of insight, motivation, consent and the legal framework for intervention. Some  challenges to accurate and meaningful risk assessment have been listed in Box 1.  P",
    "arent/carer accounts of risk behaviours as well as their ability to manage their  child’s/loved one’s eating disorder are key elements of risk assessment. We advise that  the risk assessment should be used to inform rather than dictate clinical  management.  \r\nNote: \r\nIn this guidance, you will see that some text has been shaded with different colours. This is  to highlight the ages that are being discussed.  \r\nChildren and/or young people Adults \r\nii. Risk in different populations \r\nWeight loss",
    " in children and adolescents is often more acute than in adults, due to  lower body fat stores, thus medical compromise occurs relatively frequently, and  typical features (e.g. amenorrhoea) may not be present. Working with children and  young people and their parents/carers during paediatric admissions to plan, with the  community EDS and primary care team, for care on discharge is vital (see Chapter 3).  \r\nAdults with more long-standing eating disorders may run higher levels of risk and  reach",

    " nervosa can present with severe electrolyte disturbances, and gastrointestinal  complications, even when at a normal weight or overweight. \r\nMales should be asked specifically about excess training and exercise and misuse of  anabolic or androgenic steroids. Males and some females who overtrain may have  extremely low body fat levels and larger than average muscles. Use of anabolic  steroids and Vitamin D injections can lead to increased physical risk at higher levels of  BMI (and age-adjusted ",
    "BMI) than those quoted27.  \r\nBox 1: Potential challenges to accurate risk assessment \r\n⚫ Patients can appear well and this can falsely reassure  \r\nthe clinician  \r\n⚫ Consider parent/carer information when assessing risk \r\n⚫ Patients may have an extremely powerful drive to exercise (including micro exercise, discussed in Chapter 6.b) that can override their lack of nutritional  reserve, so that they appear very energetic right up to a physical collapse.  Increased rather than reduced energy and a",
    "ctivity levels is one of the features  that distinguishes anorexia nervosa from starvation syndrome.28 \r\n⚫ Suicidal ideation is common in people with eating disorders. Suicide accounts for  the cause of death for 20% of all deaths among adults with anorexia nervosa.  Among both young people and adults with bulimia nervosa, and binge eating  disorder, the risk of self-harm and suicide is increased.29 \r\n⚫ Blood parameters that fall within laboratory reference ranges are frequently seen  in advance",

That will compound the  dismissive nature of their eating disorder cognitions and increase perception  that change is not necessary. Emphasise the severity of the problem and the lack  of precision in risk assessment while making sure to conduct the necessary  physiological and psychological examinations.  \r\n⚫ Due to the nature of eating disorder cognitions and",
    " associated distress, a  patient’s fear of weight restoration may limit their capacity to provide an  accurate account of their presentation. This can falsely reassure the clinician  about the assessment of risk. \r\n27 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31585781/ 28 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6265370/ 29 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25070478/\r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 29   \r\n2. Risk assessment: evaluating the impend",
    "ing risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\nb. An all-age risk assessment framework for assessing  impending risk to life \r\nThere have been several attempts to produce a physical risk assessment schedule,  which in the UK include the first NICE guideline on eating disorders (2004) and the  Royal College of Psychiatrists guideline on nutrition in anorexia nervosa (2005). The  \r\nmost recent NICE guideline on eating disorders advocated the use of MARSIPAN and  Junior MARSIPAN guidance to assess",
    " risk.30  \r\nThe all-age risk assessment framework below (Table 1) has been adapted from the  framework in Junior MARSIPAN, which has been adopted and used extensively since  its publication.  \r\nThe risk assessment framework combines clinical assessment with investigations,  assessment of motivation and engagement with treatment plans, and particularly for  younger patients, assessment of parent/carer support. It can help clinicians determine  the risk of serious complications to a patient of any",
    " age, including serious illness  (acute pancreatitis or gastrointestinal rupture) or death (from suicide, sudden death,  infection or cardiovascular complications31), as well risk for refeeding complications.  \r\nEach domain in Table 1 is rated with a traffic light system, indicating the risk to life.  Green indicates low impending risk to life, F indicates for the clinician to be alert to  high concern for impending risk to life, and red indicates high impending risk to life. It  is important to",
    " note that patients with bulimia nervosa who are not underweight can also present in life-threatening emergencies, due to electrolyte disturbances, and gastrointestinal complications.  \r\nThe framework is intended to guide level of concern and requires clinical judgement  for its interpretation. Nonetheless, it is based on the best available evidence and  international consensus guidance, where available (see Appendix 2). No single  parameter is, in of itself, an adequate indicator of overall lev",
    "el of risk or illness.  Moreover a ‘red’ score in one realm (e.g. electrolytes) may not be equivalent to a ‘red’  score in another area (e.g. temperature). The traffic light system is more useful for  comparing within rather than between domains. Detailed advice on diagnosis and  treatment of eating disorders in acute settings is available if needed.32,33  \r\nThe risk assessment tool is designed to aid decisions on emergency management,  such as admission for monitoring and refeeding. If any item",

However, decisions always depend on clinical judgement; the risk assessment  framework should only be an aid in that process. All patients with eating disorders  should be offered NICE approved psychological treatment at the earliest opportunity. \r\n30https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng69 para 1.11.3 ",

Differential diagnosis \r\nEating disorders can present challenges in recognition and diagnosis, in part because  consultant psychiatrists, physicians, paediatricians and other health care professionals  have limited training and expertise in the field.43 Almost all the parameters outlined in  the risk assessment framework have multiple aetiologies, and there is a need to  \r\nconsider and",
    " exclude potential organic causes. For example, the haematological  changes commonly found in anorexia nervosa can be found in primary  haematological conditions such as leukaemia and lymphoma, and can present with  pancytopaenia and weight loss, as can infection that is either acute (e.g. sepsis) or  chronic (e.g. tuberculosis).  \r\ni. Principles of differential diagnosis and eating disorders \r\nA few principles may be helpful here. First, eating disorders are relatively common,  whereas most of ",
    "the syndromes that might otherwise account for these findings are  not. Second, delay in diagnosis and treatment could lead to a continued weight loss,  which would increase risk and so should not divert the physician’s attention from the  need to provide nutrition. It may be helpful to distinguish between baseline screening  investigation to exclude organic cause/comorbidity and assessing and monitoring  risks. For example, raised liver enzymes occur regularly in patients with severe  malnutrit",
    "ion, probably as a result of hepatocellular autophagy.44 Abnormal  transaminase levels may be found during acute starvation45 as well as refeeding.46 Liver enzymes should be monitored to ensure that they decrease as nutrition is  provided, and should only be investigated if they persist despite weight restoration –  in which case an acute liver disease screen should include a viral hepatitis screen.  \r\nAll patients should have a history taken and a thorough clinical examination with  basic tests",
    " (e.g. TTg IgA for coeliac disease, blood film, CRP47) and more involved tests  if necessary. When the diagnosis is uncertain, offering food can elicit calorie-avoiding  behaviour in those with a drive for thinness and fear of weight gain. Some patients  may present with concurrent eating disorders and other pathology; these are  complex patients to manage, and specialist advice should be sought. \r\nIt would be reasonable to refer for specialist assessment any patient in  whom an eating disorder ",
    "is considered as part of the differential diagnosis  and to withdraw the referral if an alternative diagnosis is confirmed. Most  importantly, the search for a diagnosis should never delay nutritional  therapy in an undernourished patient. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6646967/ 44 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23280717/ \r\n45https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25250330/ 46 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23280717/ 47 A normal CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR (erythrocyte s",

    "risk in people under the age of 18 as follows:  \r\n⚫ Low immediate risk to life: m%BMI >80%  \r\n⚫ Medium risk: m%BMI 70–80%  \r\n⚫ High risk of life-threatening malnutrition: m%BMI <70% \r\nBMI in older adolescents  \r\nA question sometimes arises in older adolescents as to whether to use the criteria for children and young people or the criteria for adults. In line with WHO,50 we  recommend using m%BMI up to the age of 18. BMI 13 equates to less than 65%  m%BMI in a 17-year-old girl, with BMI 15 equati",
    "ng to around 70% m%BMI. As yet, there  are no empirical data supporting a low- versus high-threshold approach to  hospitalisation for medical risk and a conservative approach is justifiable. For patients  who have lost height because of osteoporosis, their past maximum adult height  should be used.  \r\nThe above notwithstanding, rate of weight loss at any BMI and with any eating  disorder can give rise to increased risk. For example, severe protein malnutrition is  common after bariatric surgery5",
    "6 when the patient may still be overweight. Hudson et  al. (2012)57 found in adolescents with early anorexia nervosa that rate of weight loss  was associated with medical instability, although many still had a m%BMI of >80%.  However, if other symptoms (e.g. potassium or suicidality) indicate a particular level of  risk, the risk should not be assessed any lower purely because of BMI and no patient  should be denied a higher level of care purely because their BMI is in the normal or  high range.",
    " In general, we recommend avoiding discussion of risk levels and BMI with  patients as this can exacerbate symptoms.  \r\nBMI in adults \r\nThere are few studies in adults to guide determination of the BMI at which risks  increase and, therefore, no overall consensus. In a study of mortality in patients with  anorexia nervosa, the mean lowest BMI of the nine patients who died of anorexia  nervosa (as opposed to suicide or other causes) was 10.69 (range 9.1–12.4).58 This gives  some rationale for a h",
    "igh-risk range being defined as BMI <13 for adults. The  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition59 uses a BMI  <15kg/m2 to connote ‘extreme’ anorexia nervosa. However, several studies have  questioned the validity of this conservative approach.60,61,62 The Royal Australian and  New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (2014)63 suggest BMI <14 for a psychiatric  \r\n55 https://www.bmj.com/content/335/7612/194 56 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5700383/ 57 https",

Risk assessment: evaluating t",
    "he impending risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\nadmission and <12 for a medical admission in adults; the British Columbia Eating  Disorders Clinical Practice Guidelines (2010)64 suggest using BMI 13–15 for medium risk  and <13 for high risk. In addition, according to ICD 11 (WHO) diagnostic criteria 6B80,  anorexia nervosa with dangerously low body weight is defined as BMI under 14.0  kg/m² in adults or under the 0.3rd percentile for BMI-for-age in children and  adolescents.65 \r\nFactori",
    "ng in the current sparsity of data and lack of consensus, we considered what  the appropriate thresholds to advise and propose the ranges for risk, as outlined in the  first edition of MARSIPAN for adults, namely:  \r\n⚫ Low immediate risk to life: BMI 15–17.5  \r\n⚫ Medium risk: BMI 13–15  \r\nHigh risk of life-threatening malnutrition: BMI <13.2. Cardiovascular findings  \r\nBradycardia is very common and well-documented in patients with anorexia nervosa.  An awake heart rate (HR) of <50 beats per min",
    "ute (bpm) should raise concern, and a  consistent HR of <40bpm is grounds for assessment by a paediatrician or physician.  Such an assessment would include lying and standing blood pressure (BP) and HR,  blood tests (to ensure that there are no electrolyte disturbances which could impact  further on cardiovascular status) and an ECG. Bradycardia associated with anorexia  nervosa and other restrictive eating disorders will improve with adequate nutritional  intake, cessation of weight loss and a ",
    "degree of weight restoration.  \r\nAn equally worrying sign is when the pulse rate is normal or high despite very low  weight66 or with low BP, which could indicate infection or dehydration. Bradycardia  associated with anorexia nervosa and other restrictive eating disorders should not  usually be treated with atropine or other cardioaccelerants.  \r\nThere may or may not be pulse rate variability with the person standing or when  under stress. HR may drop during sleep and recover with waking, but c",
    "onsistently low  HR even in sleep is a concern because it can be a precursor of potentially lethal  arrhythmia and ‘represents an ominous sign for cardiac sudden death’.67 The ECG  should be checked for heart block as an alternative cause. Patients with severe  bradycardia associated with low weight are at risk of junctional escape rhythms.68  \r\nBP in children and young people must be compared with age- and gender-based  normal values.69 The criteria in the risk assessment framework are based on",
    " data from  healthy UK children, young people and adults up to age 24. Low weight children and  young people are particularly likely to have serious medical complications of eating  disorders.70 \r\n64https://insideoutinstitute.org.au/assets/clinical%20practice%20guidelines%20for%20the%20british%20columbi a%20eating%20disorder%20continuum%20of%20services.pdf 65 https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/647582417 66 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20558930/ 67 https://pubmed",

Risk assessment: evaluating the impending risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\nSyncope and pre-syncopal symptoms are common in people suffering from  undernutrition who have an eating disorder. The concern, at least in ",
    "adults, is that  syncope may be a marker of cardiovascular instability and may reflect a predisposition  to sudden unexpected cardiovascular death in this group71. Frequent syncopal events  merit assessment by a physician or paediatrician.  \r\nOrthostatic hypotension72 is seen in undernourished people and those with rapid  weight loss and is a marker of disruption of the normal homeostatic physiological  cardiovascular mechanisms which control BP with change in posture. A postural drop  of more t",
    "han 20mmHg (systolic) or 10mmHg (diastolic), or to below 0.4–2 centiles for  age, or systolic 96–102 in adult females are also indicators of medical instability.  Moreover, a significant increase in heart rate on standing is an indicator of  cardiovascular instability. It is likely that excessive exercise adds to cardiovascular risk  in vulnerable individuals. \r\nPoor peripheral perfusion, suggested by cold hands, pale or blue peripheries and  prolonged capillary refill time, is a common observat",
    "ion in patients with anorexia  nervosa. The importance of this finding in determining physical risk is unknown.  \r\nHowever, it can lead to misdiagnosis, e.g. Raynaud's disease. Chest pain, palpitations and breathlessness can also indicate cardiovascular decompensation.  \r\nResources for monitoring cardiac risk \r\nResources required to monitor cardiac risk include:  \r\nA sphygmomanometer and appropriate range of cuff sizes.

    " BP,  postural hypotension, capillary refill time and urine output are all important but  unreliable. Serum urea and electrolytes and haematocrit may be abnormal. Weight  loss can be secondary to dehydration. Young people with eating disorders who are  undernourished usually have baseline bradycardia. In this context, a HR within the  normal range or elevated or a significant postural drop in blood pressure (>20mm Hg)  may be signs of hypovolaemia. However, no single sign of hypovolaemia is reli",
    "able and  requires the assessment of a range of clinical parameters. Caution must be taken in  treating hypovolaemia intravenously in the context of malnutrition at all ages to avoid  precipitating heart failure. Smaller aliquots (e.g. 10ml/kg IV) administered in stages are  safer. Moreover, 5% dextrose might contribute to refeeding syndrome and should be  given with caution. In general, fluid replacement should be oral or via nasogastric  tube (NGT) and the intravenous route avoided.  \r\nOver-hy",
    "dration (and oedema)  \r\nHypoalbuminaemia in the absence of other conditions is very rare in anorexia  nervosa.76 It must therefore be assessed carefully, particularly if associated with  oedema, which, in the context of an eating disorder, may be the result of refeeding,  sudden cessation of laxatives or vomiting,77 or occasionally congestive cardiac failure.  \r\nA low albumin level in a patient with an eating disorder should prompt assessment for  infection or other inflammatory causes.  \r\nIn as",
    "sessing hydration status, if the clinician is uncertain the assistance of a renal  physician can be very helpful. Over-hydration can be due to excess water  consumption and, whatever the cause, can increase risk by making true weight and  BMI very difficult to determine. This affects risk assessment and prescription of  feeding regimes. \r\n76 https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(17)30444-6/pdf 77 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21344464/\r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guida",

For healthy women aged 18–24, the  50th percentile HGS is 28.4kg and for men it is 47.8kg.80 In the cited study, below BMI  14, most female patients had HGS of <20kg and males HGS of <33.7kg, and we suggest  these levels as indicating ‘Concern’ in risk assessment.

Congenital prolonged QTc is frequently found with T wave abnormalities, in contrast to prolonged QTc in the context of undernutrition.  \r\nArrhythmias causing or likely to cause cardi",

Faecal calprotectin is a non-invasive tool that can help with differential diagnosis. \r\n5. Compensatory behaviours \r\nCompensatory behaviours occur in bulimia nervosa, purging disorder and anorexia  nervosa, and can ",
    "give rise to substantial risks.106 Purging behaviours include self induced vomiting, laxative abuse and diuretic abuse. Some biochemistry laboratories  will measure laxatives and Furosemide (diuretic) in urine.  \r\nDysfunctional exercise  \r\nThis is a form of compensatory behaviour that tends not to interfere with electrolytes,  although it can lead to hypoglycaemia107 and raised creatine kinase108 (CK) levels.  \r\n104 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26869609/ 105 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/a",

Risk assessment: evaluating the impending risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\nAbuse of amphetamines and other appetite suppressant drugs do not usually affect  electrolytes. \r\nSelf-induced vomiting  \r\nR",
    "epeated self-induced vomiting can deplete potassium from the body, at least in part  by causing alkalosis due to loss of acid from the stomach leading to increased renal  potassium excretion. The most life-threatening consequence of the resulting  hypokalaemia is sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia. ST depression, T-wave  inversion and U waves are among the changes observed on ECG.109  \r\nHypokalaemia due to vomiting has been treated with Lanzoprazole,110 which blocks  acid secretion in the st",
    "omach and so prevents alkalosis from developing. Other  serious complications of vomiting are oesophagitis due to reflux and haematemesis  due to Mallory–Weiss syndrome. Rarely, purging can lead to oesophageal rupture,  with persisting chest pain and signs of systemic illness.  \r\nFunctional gastrointestinal symptoms \r\nThese include bloating (sometimes related to delayed gastric emptying and slow  bowel transit, related to malnutrition and laxative abuse), and are very common in  patients with ea",
    "ting disorders. They rarely reflect physical risk but can be distressing  to the patient, and difficult to interpret. Consider referral to a paediatrician or  physician with appropriate expertise who can advise and guide any further  assessment or investigation. Such a referral should not delay refeeding.  \r\nLaxative misuse \r\nTaking laxatives to try to avoid weight gain occurs in anorexia nervosa, bulimia  nervosa and OSFED (purging disorder). The number of tablets taken can escalate,  probably ",
    "because they become less effective. The resulting diarrhoea causes loss of  electrolytes, resulting in hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and dehydration111.  Prolonged laxative abuse can cause colonic atony due to progressive weakness of the  colonic muscle, and chronic constipation and rectal prolapse can follow, sometimes  requiring colectomy.  \r\nLaxative abuse is rare in children under the age of 15 years (0–1.8%) and reflects the  general population level from 15–18 years (3.2–5.5%).112 It is fo",
    "und in 4.18% of the  general population and 15–70% of people with eating disorders. \r\nDiuretic misuse \r\nIn eating disorders, diuretics may be used to lower weight, although, as in laxative  abuse, the reduction is illusory as it is due to loss of water from the body. They cause  dehydration, hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and the reduced plasma volume may  lead to an elevation in serum aldosterone levels.113 Thus, when the diuretics are  stopped, the patient can experience severe oedema, which can",
    " cause enormous  anxiety in the context of intense body image concerns.

Other biochemical and endocrine abnormalities \r\nThyroid function \r\nSick euthyroid syndrome (abnormal thyroid function tests without pre-existing  thyroid or pituitary disease) may occur in anorexia nervosa with lowered",
    "  triiodothyronine levels, low thyroxine levels, and elevated reverse T3115, 116. The  important differential diagnosis is secondary hypothyroidism due to a thyroid tumour.  Occasionally thyroxine levels can be elevated due to thyroxine, obtained medically or  via the internet, being consumed as a weight-loss aid. A careful history and  examination and assessment of other hormones in the pituitary should be  undertaken. Referral to a paediatrician or endocrinologist should be considered. \r\nHypog",
    "lycaemia \r\nPatients with severe anorexia nervosa have limited fat stores, and if their dietary  intake is minimal, ketones will be produced by beta-oxidation of fats and to a smaller  extent from lipogenic amino acids released mainly from muscle protein. It should be  borne in mind that prolonged ketosis may contribute to reduction in bone mineral  density117. In practice, most patients with anorexia nervosa are carrying enough  glycogen to maintain blood glucose.118 However, in a severely malno",
    "urished patient  who has used up all glycogen and fat stores, fatal hypoglycaemia becomes a  possibility119 although it can also result from other conditions (e.g. Addison’s disease) and, if persistent despite feeding, needs to be investigated. Hypoglycaemia can occur  in extreme malnutrition,120,121,122particularly in adults, and can lead to death if not  treated. It represents extreme depletion of glycogen stores. Importantly, ketotic  hypoglycaemia should not be treated with rapid-acting carb",
    "ohydrate (e.g. GlucoGel)  but rather with more complex carbohydrates (e.g. food).  \r\nIt is important to check ketones (using urine or capillary test strips) at the time of  hypoglycaemia.  \r\nNonketotic hypoglycaemia is always pathological and rare. It is most commonly seen  in insulin overdose, where insulin excess prevents ketogenesis and leads to  neuroglycopaenic (drowsiness/mood change) and adrenergic symptoms.

Risk assessment: evaluating the impending risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\nIn bulimia nervosa, and in the binge/purge form of anorexia n",
    "ervosa and OSFED, most  biochemical abnormalities are related to purging (i.e. self-induced vomiting and  laxative abuse), which can lead to renal impairment. Hypoglycaemia can also  occur123,124, possibly related to binge-related insulin surges.  \r\nCreatine kinase  \r\nCK is an enzyme contained in muscle cells and released when the muscle is damaged.  In eating disorders, the two most common causes of raised CK are muscle autophagy  (i.e. the body metabolising muscle as a source of nutrition) and",
    " over-exercising, which  \r\ncan result in very high CK levels in undernourished patients who exercise.125,126 Increased CK is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, in which selective  increase in the cardiac iso-enzymes (CK-MB) in contrast to the skeletal muscle iso enzymes (CK-MM). In one reported case report of a patient with anorexia nervosa,127 CK was greatly raised at 2,580 iu/L and 3.5% was found to be CK-MB, i.e. 90 iu/L, which  is nearly four times the upper limit of normal, sug",

However, it has been reported that exercising athletes may have an  abnormally raised serum level of CK-MB128 which may have relevance for patients with  eating disorders who suffer with dysfunctional exercise.  \r\nMicronutrients  \r\nVitamin deficiencies can give rise to abnormal blood tests, for example vitamin C  deficiency causing anaemia, and low calcium and phosphate in vitamin D deficiency.  Thiamine deficiency, associated with a low level of re",
    "d-cell transketolase, is found in  beriberi and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (a neurological disease caused by  thiamine deficiency characterised by ataxia, visual changes and memory impairment),  as well as 38% of patients with anorexia nervosa.129 Most adult units give thiamine  routinely during refeeding (see Chapter 4) because of the potential risk of inducing  Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Other vitamin deficiencies, including B12 or folate  deficiency can cause serious consequences. Scurvy m",

The psychiatric interview helps to establish if the patient  has a mental disorder and whether they have capacity, which are essential for  decision-making about treatment options. However, with very young patients, be  particularly careful to ask open questions to avoid s",
    "uggesting specific behaviours or  cognitions. Only become specific if responses to open questions raise concern. Table 4 presents some psychological symptoms that can affect the patient’s response to  treatment. \r\nMedication and restraint  \r\nIf patients are finding eating extremely challenging, they may react against attempts  to encourage food intake. Some might even become aggressive towards staff who are  trying to help them, due to high level of anxiety and distress. In such an extreme  situ",
    "ation, patients may need additional measures such as medication or even  restraint, to support the process of refeeding. This can further exacerbate distress,  perhaps increasing the risk of self-harm and suicide, and it is important to seek advice  from a consultant psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders to help devise a safe  treatment plan. In contrast, some patients may appear extremely cooperative while  remaining terrified of change and consequently negating efforts at nutritional  ",
    "rehabilitation. Avoid prolonged negotiations. Patients value clinicians responding with  compassion to the distressing thoughts underpinning their fears, while delivering a  clear message that adequate nutrition and reduction in any eating disorder  compensatory behaviours is essential. Clinicians are advised to monitor whether  interactions between staff and patient improve the latter’s behaviour or the reverse  and modify the approach of staff accordingly. \r\nNeurological examination \r\nPoor att",

Confusion and delirium are rarer, but  extremely worrying; they may reflect refeeding syndrome (see Chapter 4), Wernicke’s  encephalopathy, or be evidence of other infectious, metabolic or neoplastic pathology.

This gives clinicians an  indication of the patient’s attitude to treatment, which can manifest in firmly held  wishes to lose weight or maintain a low weight. However, equally, there may be lack of  t",
    "rust in the system and the staff, which can lead to a lack of adherence to treatment,  including weight restoration. Staff need to recognise this ambivalence, avoid  confrontation, gain trust and work collaboratively with the patient, their family  members and carers, and other members of the team, to help the patient through the  illness. Input from mental health nurses or other staff who have been trained to  support mealtimes can facilitate patients managing their meals on paediatric or  medi",
    "cal wards. \r\nIn approaching a patient with eating disorder behaviours, the interviewer should  assume that it is a sensitive and difficult area. Many dietitians and nurses are expert at  this type of negotiation. Try to elicit the patient’s confidence to begin with and ask  open questions. Here is an example conversation: \r\n“The nurses have told me that you are not that happy to go along with the  meal plan. Can you explain that to me a bit?”  \r\n“You’re just trying to make me fat.” \r\n“OK, I unde",

Is there a way we could  make it just a little more acceptable?” \r\n“Well, you could cut out the ice-cream for a start.” \r\n“OK, we can replace that with a banana and work from there.”\r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 56 \r\n2. Risk assessment: evaluating the impending risk to life due to the patient’s illness \r\nNegotiating a little in this way can be helpful, although in time the patient will ne",
    "ed to  accept the need for weight gain, which can be a big hurdle. \r\nPatients with eating disorders (especially young people) can reach a critically ill state  quickly, with rapid weight loss, or (more in adults) slowly with weight loss over months  or years. With long-standing low weight, it can be hard to know how to apply the risk  parameters. This is particularly the case in patients with ARFID, whose low weight may  be lifelong and who appear to have a physiologically accommodated to being ",
    "low  weight. Patients with eating disorders may find the increase in nutrition required for  weight restoration very difficult to manage, so respecting these difficulties and  forging an alliance with the patient with the help and support of their family and  carers is important.  \r\nv. Risks associated with eating disorders comorbid with  emotionally unstable personality disorder or autism spectrum  disorder \r\nWhile emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder (EUPD) has a point  preva",
    "lence of 1–2% in the population, recent studies131 suggest that EUPD is commonly  seen together with eating disorders. Similarly, the prevalence of autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) and eating disorders is higher than in the population as a whole 132, and  the presence of ASD traits may have an impact on treatment response and  outcome133.  \r\nTreatment of eating disorders and EUPD may be complicated because therapy for the  eating symptoms can interfere with therapy for the EUPD, while EUPD sympto",
    "ms  such as self-harm and substance misuse, can hamper attention to the eating disorder. In people with ASD, it can be difficult to discern whether symptoms, such as  inflexibility and detail focus, are attributable to the eating disorder or to ASD, and  therefore whether they are best challenged or accommodated.  \r\nManaging high level of distress if a patient has significant comorbidity will require the  support of a specialist EDS team. and also professionals, who specialise in the  management",
    " of ASD. \r\nManagement protocol for care setting \r\nWhile hospital admission may be necessary for high-risk eating disorder symptoms, it  is important to consider unintended harm for some patients.. Prolonged inpatient  psychiatric care has been thought134 to be “at best neutral and at worst damaging to  the long-term recovery of people with personality disorder”, although this view has  been challenged135. Reducing the number of autistic people in inpatient care  continues to be a priority for go",

We recommend that units  treating patients with eating disorders are members of one of the quality networks  described below.  \r\nWhen people with eating disorders are admitted a long distance away from home,  consideration must be given as to how to support them to maintain links with their  family a",

Decisions on accepting a patient for a  SEDU or a SEDB should be made by SEDU or SEDB outreach staff, usually a  consultant psychiatrist, and this should be part of the doctor’s agreed job description  in NHS or private units.

    "oung people requiring hospitalisation, 3 weeks has been suggested  for a structured admission to a paediatric setting for restrictive eating disorders138,  although in practice the duration will depend on the severity of presentation and an  assessment of community support and parent/carer needs. Most patients discharged  from paediatric wards will be managed by a specialist community EDS, with a minority  requiring further treatment in an SEDU or SEDB. In the latter scenario, if there is diffic",
    "ulty  obtaining access to an SEDB or SEDU, this should be escalated to local NHS  management. Adult patients with severe eating disorders requiring admission should be  cared for by a specialist EDS (in either inpatient or community settings) unless they need  medical services that the EDS cannot provide. If they have psychiatric symptoms such as  severe self-harm which might be exacerbated in an inpatient setting, assessment by  appropriate psychiatric experts should be arranged and a care plan",
    "ning meeting  convened in order to recommend the most appropriate management. We suggest that  patients with pre-existing electrolyte or renal abnormalities or comorbidity that increase  the risk of refeeding syndrome, such as significant infection, should be admitted to a  medical ward or a psychiatric unit with excellent medical support, for cautious  introduction of feeds with quick-turnaround biochemical monitoring more than once  daily.  \r\n2. If a SEDU or SEDB is indicated but unavailable, ",
    "the choice is between a medical and a  general psychiatric bed without SEDB services. Factors such as the quality of liaison  between medical/paediatric team and the EDS, the experience of the general psychiatric  unit of managing malnutrition, as well as the clinical condition of the patient and  requirements for monitoring, will influence the decision. In many areas there will be a  EDS responsible for the population or a liaison team at a nearby hospital. We suggest  that a senior member of t",
    "he EDS or liaison team consult with medical/paediatric and  psychiatric colleagues to develop a local strategy to address this problem. This should  include training of the general psychiatry or CAMHS team, including consultant  psychiatrist input. If a patient is admitted to a medical hospital, we recommend  obtaining support from an EDS or a liaison psychiatry service near or in the hospital. A  general psychiatric unit should also obtain specialist support and be equipped to offer  nasogastri",

The oldest and best-established of these is the  Quality Network for Inpatient CAMHS (QNIC), which has a subsection of quality  standards for inpatient units treating children and young people with eating  disorders. A network for adult inpatient eating disorders units and a network for  community EDSs have now been added, comprising the Quali",
    "ty Network for Eating  Disorders.142 We recommend that inpatient units routinely admitting patients with  eating disorders should adhere to these standards and participate in peer review  accreditation visits.  \r\nc. Transfer between services \r\nSeveral patient’s deaths and other near-miss incidents have occurred following  transfer between services at all levels (transfer between CAMHS and adult services,  between two inpatient units, between medical units and specialist inpatient services,  betw",
    "een primary and secondary care). There are a number of reasons for this. The risk  is higher if the patient does not find the receiving unit acceptable, the explanation for  which may relate to the receiving unit (inadequate resources, lack of appropriate staff,  or that it is new and unknown), or it may be the patient who is unable to accept help  because of the nature and severity of their disorder. Lack of consent for such a transfer  needs careful consideration, with assessment of capacity a",
    "nd risk, and consultation  with family members. Transitions occur in many ways and here discussion is confined  to those transitions which can give rise to medical emergencies. Refer to reports by  NICE143, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists144 for a broader discussion. \r\ni. Primary to secondary care \r\nIn primary care, because severe anorexia nervosa is seen relatively rarely, there can be  a risk of a delay in recognition.145 Moreover, normal blood tests and relatively preserved  energy lev",
    "els can be falsely reassuring. Any patient with a severe eating disorder can  deteriorate rapidly, and should be referred without delay. We recommend that the GP  discuss any patient of concern with an eating disorders or liaison psychiatry clinician,  the local CAMHS service or a paediatrician/physician, providing as much information  from the risk assessment as possible. In primary care, regular weight measurement  and repeating any even mildly abnormal test will improve the accuracy of risk  ",
    "assessment, and hence inform how urgently the patient should be assessed.

    "made with a clear management  plan and requirements for monitoring as well as contingency plans if these do not go  well. The patient must participate in this process and have a chance to pose questions. \r\nii. Transferring from one unit to another \r\nPatients transferring between psychiatric, eating disorder and medical units face  particular risks. It is the responsibility of the unit arranging the transfer to make sure  that it is carried out safely and efficiently. Patients should be stabilise",
    "d prior to  transfer. Patients are usually in a very frail condition, therefore, for their own safety  care should be taken to ensure they cannot tamper with their treatment. Use of the  Mental Health Act or Mental Capacity Act or equivalent legislation and combined  medical treatment, psychiatric monitoring and restraint may be required. Occasional  high-dependency care should be available, funded separately by the local NHS  commissioners, to provide intensive medical and psychiatric care for ",
    "such patients if  needed. \r\nThe choice of transport will depend on local circumstances and geography. Transfer  by air ambulance may be the quickest method but can expose the patient to cold and  other stresses. A longer transfer by a road ambulance may sometimes be safer, and  the potential risks and benefits need to be weighed carefully.  \r\nUnits should be aware of what is available for patients in nearby areas and have had  discussions about where things go wrong. Paediatric/medical units wil",
    "l usually be  more worried about nursing care and behavioural management; psychiatric units  about medical risk, so understanding what is lacking in each setting is important in  improving working together in the interests of patients. If there is no clear shared-care  arrangement, it is possible that there will be false expectations around the  responsibilities of the teams involved. Staff in an acute hospital may not feel confident  to start refeeding if the patient does not cooperate or is in",
    " distress, and expect the  psychiatric team to take responsibility, whereas the psychiatric team may assume  that the patient will be physically stabilised before transition takes place. As a result,  the patient can get worse in the medical/paediatric setting, and may even be too  unwell to be transferred to a psychiatric unit once a bed becomes available.  \r\nYoung people aged 16–18 are particularly at risk if they fall between paediatric and  adult services. We advocate specific discussion wit",
    "h local providers about patients in  this age group, in which many ‘paediatric’ issues such as impaired growth and  development are still prominent and need of paediatric expertise. Moreover, at any  age, discussions about physical, psychiatric, dietetic and nursing management should  take place between members of those professional groups in both locations, with  written handovers. In any setting, it is essential that, if the patient’s needs exceed the capability of ward staff, help, support an",
    "d advice is requested from the appropriate  service.\r\nCR233: Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders: Guidance on Recognition and Management │ 64 \r\n3. Location of care and transfer between services \r\niii. Transfers between CAMHS and adult services  \r\nAlthough it is recognised that transition from CAMHS to adult EDS is an important146 time of heightened risk, research in this area is limited. The TRACK (Transition from  CAMHS to Adult Mental Health Services) study found that ‘Optimal transition, ",
    "defined  as adequate transition planning, good information transfer across teams, joint  working between teams and continuity of care following transition, was experienced  by less than 5% of those who made a transition.’147 Often there is a significant cultural  and resource difference between CAMHS and adult services, with young people’s EDS  mindful of the responsibilities of the parents/carers and adult EDS focusing on  individual responsibility. Differences in culture around responsibility ",
    "are reflected, for  example, in responses to patient non-attendance. \r\nTransfers between CAMHS and adult services need careful planning, making sure that  the young person is capable of taking responsibility or their capacity to make  decisions about treatment is clarified. Capacity is assumed from the age of 16 until  proven otherwise, but it can be difficult to assess in the context of eating disorders  (see Chapter 8). Without a careful transition, a sudden change of approach can cause  confu",
    "sion and dissatisfaction at best and tragedy at worst. Both services should take  advantage of the knowledge of the patient and family in the long term that can be  provided by the primary care team. The GP can be an important bridge, providing  support to the patient and their family during transfer between CAMHS and adult  services. Transition issues also occur when a young person leaves home to go to a  distant institution for higher education and training, and all health care services,  prim",
    "ary and secondary, under- and over-18s, should communicate with counterparts  in the new location so that patients with eating disorders do not fall through the net.  Both the Royal College of Psychiatrists148 and, more recently, the NHS Long Term  Plan149 envisage mental health services from birth to 25 years in the expectation that  this will address some of the problems of transition we have described. However, in  some areas, admission of someone aged 16–18can raise difficulties: “16‐ and 17",
    "‐year‐ olds may be managed in either [adult or paediatric wards], with no consistency across  services, and sometimes there are ‘end of the bed’ arguments over which service is  responsible for the care of a [young adult or adolescent]”.150 \r\niv. Summary \r\nTransitions between different health providers provide substantial challenges and  much can go wrong. A structured handover template/agreement as per NICE  guidelines151 and agreed protocols152 between services can help to ensure safe transfer",

Introduction \r\nThis section contains recommendations which are at the core of this guidance and is designed to facilitate physicians, paediatricians, dietitians, nurses and psychiatrists  and other health professionals working together with the p",

In this chapter, refeeding and how to achieve it safely is discussed. As elsewhere, all age advice is provided when appropriate, separating into age groups when the  content or evidence demands. The emphasis is on treatment of anorexia nervosa,  although rapid weight loss and the need for careful nutritional",

Figure 3 provides a decision tree on  how to approach the management of a severe eating disorder, which can begin in  primary care.

Safe refeeding of malnourished patients with restrictive eating disorders \r\nb. Refeeding and ‘underfeeding’ syndromes: recognition,  avoidance and mana",
    "gement  \r\nRefeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal condition155 that occurs when patients  whose food intake has been severely restricted are given nutrition via oral, enteral or  parenteral routes. Sudden reversal of prolonged starvation by the reintroduction of  food leads to rapid shifts of electrolytes back into cells from which they had, during  starvation, been leached out. Phosphate, potassium and magnesium levels can fall  very rapidly within the first week of refeeding, with neurologic",
    "al and cardiovascular  consequences: this is known as the refeeding syndrome. The resulting effects, most  notably cardiac compromise, can be fatal. Respiratory failure, liver dysfunction, central  nervous system abnormalities, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are also recognised  complications and patients are at risk of vitamin deficiencies. Refeeding syndrome  usually occurs within 72 hours of beginning refeeding, with a range of 1–5 days156, but  bear in mind that it can occur late (in one study,",
    " up to 18 days) in the most  malnourished. Hence patients discharged before 20 days should be followed up to  check electrolytes and detect late appearing refeeding syndrome.  \r\nDefinitions of refeeding syndrome are highly heterogeneous among studies, with  some studies only relying on electrolyte disturbances with different cut-offs, and  others also integrating clinical parameters. The definitions by Mariks157 and Rio et al.158 are the most commonly used (see Table 7). While refeeding syndrome",
    " is an important threat to patients with anorexia nervosa and other restrictive eating disorders, there  have been more reported deaths in anorexia nervosa from underfeeding, which  sometimes occurs because staff fear inducing refeeding syndrome159.  \r\nTable 7: Clinical and laboratory features of refeeding syndrome (adapted from  Rio et al., 2013160)  \r\nClinical and laboratory features of established refeeding syndrome \r\nNote: Not all features need to be present. \r\n1.

Safe refeeding of malnourished patients with restrictive eating disorders \r\n  \r\nSymptoms of refeeding syndrome can occur in inpatients or outpatients. Monitoring  for hypophosphataemia ",
    "is essential, because it is one of the earliest clinical indicators  that heralds onset of refeeding syndrome and is easily treatable. Hypophosphataemia  is defined as a phosphate level <1mmol/L (adolescents)161 and <0.8mmol/L (adults)162.  The incidence of hypophosphataemia during refeeding varies, but is typically reported  in 8–18% in adolescents admitted with anorexia nervosa for refeeding163,164.  \r\nCase study 1: A patient with a BMI of 14.5 had been eating almost  nothing. His psychiatrist",
    " told him that unless he could reverse the  weight loss, he might find himself in hospital. Terrified by this  \r\nprospect, he began to overeat (binge) to restore weight. Within 3  days, his serum phosphate level had fallen to 0.6mmol/L and he  \r\nrequired oral phosphate supplements to correct this abnormality. \r\nTraditionally, refeeding syndrome has been managed by hypocaloric feeding with  slow introduction of calories 165166. This approach seems to be appropriate for patients  with malnutrition",
    " due to medical illness, in whom a coexistent inflammatory response  is often present, which may increase the likelihood of refeeding syndrome. Patients in  which an acute inflammatory response is present usually have significant underlying  medical conditions and should be treated as high risk and managed in a medical  setting. Patients with uncomplicated anorexia nervosa do not usually have an acute  inflammatory response and typically have normal plasma albumin, urea and CRP. \r\nHowever, the c",
    "autious approach advocated for those with medical conditions can  result in underfeeding in some patients with anorexia nervosa. Underfeeding occurs  when clinicians are overly concerned about the risk of refeeding syndrome or follow  guidance intended for medically compromised patients. Underfeeding can  inadvertently prolong the acute risk of potentially life-threatening undernutrition167.  \r\nCase study 2: An adolescent girl was transferred from the  \r\nadolescent psychiatric unit to the paedia",
    "tric setting because she  \r\nwas losing weight and had become medically unstable. On the  \r\npaediatric ward, refeeding via NGT was instituted at a cautious rate following nutritional guidelines. She lost a further 6kg on the  \r\npaediatric ward before a specialist opinion was sought. \r\nThere are several studies, including three randomised controlled trials, published  since 2013 reflecting increased awareness of refeeding syndrome and demonstrating  that, with higher-calorie approaches and electro",

    "nourished patients with restrictive eating disorders \r\nsyndrome is manageable168169 at least in adolescents. Together with the literature on refeeding syndrome (see Chapter 4.b), and clinical experience, this suggests that for  most patients, an overly cautious approach to refeeding is not necessary, but close  monitoring is required. Garber et al.’s study170 concludes that higher calorie refeeding  beginning at 2000kcal/day from the outset increasing by 200kcal/day is safe for most  patients. H",

If neither are managed, NGT feeding may be required. \r\nGuidelines on initiation rates for refeeding patients with anorexia nervosa vary  significantly and is an area of ongoing academic and clinical debate. Suggested  caloric intakes range from 5–10kcal/kg176 in high-risk patients, 25–35kcal/kg/day for  adults and 50kcal/kg/day for 15- to 18-yea",
    "r-olds177 and up to 60kcal/kg/day for 11- to 14- year-olds178. We agree with the British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines,179 who recommend that refeeding starts at 30–35kcal/kg/day (less if the patient is of very low  weight and clinically unstable) and increases by 200–300kcal/day every 2–3 days, so  that weight is starting to increase by the seventh day (although this may be delayed if  purging, tampering with feed, or other behaviours driven by fear of weight restoration  continuing). A",

The Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Group of the BDA have  produced a useful guide to managing and avoiding refeeding syndrome.182 \r\nRefeeding: Summary of research in adolescents \r\nThe ",
    "evidence to guide refeeding is stronger in adolescents than in adults. Whitelaw  et al. (2010),183 in a sample of 29 adolescents in Australia, with a mean body weight of  72.9%, found that, starting at 1,900kcal or higher in the majority of the sample, 37% of  patients developed mild hypophosphataemia and no one developed moderate or  \r\nsevere hypophosphataemia. This equates to about 42kcal/kg/day for a 45kg adolescent or 47.5kcal/kg/day for a 40kg adolescent. However, four adolescents were  con",
    "sidered at sufficiently high risk to start with lower regimes or on rehydration alone.  Low body weight was associated with the subsequent development of  hypophosphataemia. Madden et al. (2015),184 also in Australia, studied a rapid  refeeding protocol, starting at 2,400kcal/day with a combination of low carbohydrate  NGT and oral feeds, and weaning onto full oral diet of 2,400–3,000kcal/day over 2  weeks. They found no indicators of refeeding syndrome in 78 patients aged 12–18 years  with a me",

(2016)185 carried out the first multicentre, single blinded, randomised  controlled trial of 36 patients with anorexia nervosa, aged 10–16 years, in UK paediatric  settings. Mean m%BMI was lower in this study, at 70%, with all patients under  78%. Participants were randomised to start refeeding at 500kcal/day (control group,  mean calories 16kcal/kg/day) or at 1,200kcal/day (intervention group, mean calories  38kcal/kg/day), with both groups increasing by 200k",
    "cal/day. Refeeding at the higher  rate had no adverse effect on QTc interval or heart rate and no significant increase in  the incidence or severity of hypophosphataemia. \r\nA more recent trial186 used an even higher caloric regime, comparing outcomes from  higher-calorie refeeding, beginning at 2,000kcal/d and increasing by 200kcal/d, versus  lower-calorie refeeding, beginning at 1,400kcal and increasing by 200kcal every other  day in 120 adolescents. Short-term outcomes found that the higher-ca",

    "d lower-calorie refeeding groups187.  \r\nIn summary, the most up-to-date evidence suggests that for adolescents, starting at  1,400–2,000kcal/day, and increasing by at least 200kcal/day up to around  2,400kcal/day (some patients require higher calorie intakes to gain weight), is safe for  all except patients at highest risk, provided that medical parameters are closely  monitored (see Table 7). A key consideration is that no patient should be started on a  lower-calorie amount than they were eati",
    "ng prior to admission, provided that there is  confidence in self-reported intakes. An expectation is set that there will be a steady  calorie increase until weight restoration of 0.5–1kg/week188 is achieved. Higher rates of  weight gain, up to 2kg/week, are thought to be safe as long as there is close psycho physical monitoring. In one inpatient study189 the mean optimal rate of weight gain  was 2.1kg/week and 5% of the series gained over 3.3kg per week. Higher-calorie  refeeding seems to be we",
    "ll tolerated, provided that the patient is closely monitored  with electrolyte replacement190. No study of higher-calorie feeding since 2010 has  reported a case of refeeding syndrome.  \r\nRefeeding: Summary of research in adults \r\nIn adults, the evidence base is much weaker and opinion is divided between SEDUs,  in which higher calories are provided from the outset, and medical units, in which,  undoubtedly, more unwell patients are seen and where practice is more conservative.  There is an urge",
    "nt need for a study of refeeding adults with anorexia nervosa in order  to establish an evidence base for practice. In the absence of large prospective studies  we offer the following guidance: \r\n1. First, identify any medical comorbidities that make the patients at high risk of  refeeding syndrome. Examples are diabetes mellitus and occult sepsis, which is  often missed. (See Table 1, Risk Assessment Framework and Table 2, guidance  on management of clinical findings)  \r\n2. The patient should n",
    "ot be started on fewer calories than they were consuming  prior to admission; because feeding is the life-saving treatment that needs to  be administered, this should be the clinical priority. If intake is uncertain, start  as per point 3 or 4 (below) depending on risk. \r\n3. Patients with anorexia nervosa with evidence of an acute inflammatory  response (i.e. raised CRP), low albumin, deranged electrolytes or raised WCC  should be regarded as at high risk of refeeding syndrome and other potentia",
    "l  complications and managed accordingly. \r\n4. If the patient has a BMI<13 in addition to the clinical features suggesting  additional physical risk described in point 3 (above), then start feeding at  around 10kcals/kg/day increasing daily. It is rarely necessary to delay daily increases in calories due to refeeding syndrome or pending electrolyte  correction. Similarly, it is not necessary to delay starting feeding to correct  \r\n187 https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/ear",

    "ate care area for correction while feeding is  established.  \r\n5. In the absence of other medical comorbidities, feeding can be safely started at  a higher level than in patients who are malnourished for other reasons. \r\nAlthough there is a dearth of published data in adults, the total number of adults  reported in case studies and five case series191, 192, 193, 194, 195 is at least 296. While refeeding  hypophosphataemia is reported (up to 45% in the most severely ill patients), no case  of ref",
    "eeding syndrome or death is reported from this five-case series. However, the  frequency with which refeeding hypophosphataemia occurs does point to the risk of  refeeding syndrome which, although rare, can be fatal. Patients admitted to medical  units may well be more unwell and have lower BMI than those admitted to SEDUs,  and also may have coexisting complications such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalance and cardiac failure, and the combination of such factors will influence the risk of refeedin",
    "g  syndrome and complicate treatment.  \r\nWeighing up the risk of refeeding syndrome with the risk of underfeeding syndrome,  which has been associated with a number of deaths, we regard as overly cautious. Published recommendations such as those from the American Society for Parenteral  and Enteral Nutrition196 in which “10–20kcal/kg for the first 24 hours, advance by 33% of  goal every 1 to 2 days” is recommended for all patients with anorexia nervosa with  BMI <16. Similarly, BAPEN197 recommen",
    "d a maximum of 10kcal/kg per day, which we  regard as too conservative in uncomplicated patients at lower risk of refeeding  syndrome. In adults with anorexia nervosa with no features of an acute medical  condition or inflammatory response, and with a BMI >13, the limited data suggest that  higher rates of feeding can be used safely, provided the patient is monitored carefully  and appropriate action taken if refeeding syndrome develops. \r\nIn summary, adult patients with evidence of active medic",
    "al comorbidities, particularly  if acutely ill, or with a BMI <13 should be refed cautiously, ideally in a unit with  experience in refeeding critically ill patients. There is a consensus among eating  disorder specialists contributing to this document that for patients admitted to EDSs  (SEDUs, SEDBs) and those without features suggesting increased risk, refeeding can  proceed more rapidly, as recommended by the BDA. In all cases, patients must be  monitored frequently, given vitamins, especial",
    "ly thiamine, and underfeeding avoided.  \r\nii. Initiating nutrition during refeeding \r\nThe process of improving nutrition in someone who has been eating very little can be  difficult for the patient. At the same time, the staff are tasked with getting quite a  technical process right, and as long as they do, the patient will get better and  hopefully will be able to take over responsibility for their nutrition in time.

    "s for planning managing a holiday  away from home\r\n1\r\nFor most people, going on holiday feels like a relaxing treat. For a person with  ARFID it can feel overwhelming, full of uncertainty and anxiety. If you/your child  takes nutritional supplements it is advisable that you take these with you. Include  any necessary medical notes for travel. If possible, also pack safe foods and  snacks to take with you. If suitcase space is tight, you may need to take an extra  case with you. Consider also tak",
    "ing safe plates/ cutlery/ drinking containers. This  can make a big difference to food and fluid intake. \r\nThese steps can feel like an unnecessary and unwelcome expense or sacrifice to  those of us who don’t have ARFID. But for those who do and their families, it  could be the key to enjoying a holiday away from home.\r\n2\r\nIt can seem logical to assume that if you don’t take safe foods with you, then  you/your child will eat the local variety. We assume this will happen because there  are no oth",
    "er options. With ARFID this is not the case and is likely to lead to a  deterioration in mental health and wellbeing. Any restriction of food and fluid may  also require medical attention away from home. It is therefore strongly  recommended that you do not try this strategy.\r\n3\r\nThink about your journey and have a plan of what to eat and when, whether this is  a car journey, a boat, train or plane. If you are flying, consider what you can take  with you through an airport. Think about whether y",
    "ou need a medical note or need  to contact your airline. This may be necessary to take foods or fluids through with  you. Jetlag or time-zone differences can pose a problem. If this is likely and you  or your child eats at very fixed and specific times, think about how best you will  manage this. Keeping to your/their usual food routine whilst away can reduce  anxiety. Even if this doesn’t fit with the local timescales for meals, it could be  helpful to stick to your/their routine. \r\nYour journe",
    "y should also include preparation of what to expect. For example,  thinking through all the steps involved in an airport and flight. this would include  understanding unpredictable events like traffic and turbulence. Where possible,  use visual aids (like images of the airport) to help. It may also be helpful for your  journey to include items which help you to manage in new environments. For  example, using headphones, screen devices or games, or using fidget toys.\r\n4 \r\nIt is important to remem",
    "ber that even small taste changes can mean that a usual  food or fluid is not accepted. Therefore, consider working towards planning these  in advance. For example, can bottled water be tolerated instead of tap? Could  cordial be used to keep the flavour the same? Could UHT milk be a goal that is  worked towards instead of fresh milk? It may be appropriate for you to practice  some local cuisine before you go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.Ellison, RD, P.Falcoski RD and U.Philpot (February 2024) \r\n5\r\nThink about the",
    " safest and easiest foods that can be managed. These should be  ones which have as little variation as possible. This can mean that for one or two  weeks it will be ok if the same few foods are eaten across all meals and snacks.  This is something we call ‘minimally safe’. However, make sure there is a plan to  come out of this very restrictive pattern again once you return home. \r\nTry to change how your think. Safe food could be seen as something you feel  defeated or disappointed by. Instead, ",
    "consider safe food as fuel that allows you to  enjoy the holiday.\r\n6\r\nPlan ahead. If possible, discuss your needs with your hotel or any restaurants you  plan to visit. This could mean asking to reserve a quieter or less public table. Or it  could mean requesting permission to bring your own food to a restaurant. You  may be able to try similar foods at home prior to going or gain an understanding of  the hotel/restaurant menu. This can help you to plan what you will eat and when  (including dat",
    "es and times), in advance.\r\n7\r\nDiscussing your/your child’s ARFID needs can be a difficult experience. Where  possible, writing these needs down so that you have something you can give to  those who ask can be helpful. It may be helpful to try and source this in the  language of your destination if this is different. \r\n8\r\nWhilst you should not assume that it will be possible to eat local foods, it can be a  good opportunity for variety. Holidays can feel more relaxed and are outside the  usual e",
    "nvironment. In novel environments some people do better with eating. However, this only works if the pressure is low and safe foods remain available. \r\nCreate opportunities to partake in other foods or social food experiences. During  these, keep pressure and expectations low and allow yourself/them to go at  your/their own pace. Choosing to stick to the safe foods isn’t a failure. Just being  around new foods and experiences is a positive challenge.\r\n9 \r\nSometimes, despite all your planning and",
    " preparation efforts, something can still  go ‘wrong’. This often causes lots of emotion or distress. When this happens,  having a toolkit of basic strategies to reduce arousal can be helpful. These will be  different for each person. Try to think about what sensory input/strategies relaxes  you and work with this. Some examples might include dimming the lights or  finding a quiet space. It could mean using tactile objects like fidget toys. Engaging  in kinetic movement is helpful for some. This",
    " includes going for a walk or moving  your arms/legs in a way which aids relaxation (known as stimming). Abdominal  breathing and using strong/grounding smells (like essential oils) can also help.\r\n10 \r\nAs a person with ARFID or a carer for a person with ARFID, try to adjust your  expectations of what a holiday ‘should be’. Reasonable adjustments to support  the needs of someone with ARFID still makes for an enjoyable holiday for all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf helpful, ARFID awareness cards in English (which e",

Some examples might be:  psychologist, psychiatrist, Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN), counsellor, Cognitive Behaviour  Therapy (CBT) therapist etc. It may be useful to have their phone numbers and / or location too.\r\n\r\n",
    "\r\n\r\n2. DIAGNOSIS\r\nICD10 / DSM-IV \r\n(See Diagnostic Criteria section)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CURRENT MEDICATION\r\n∙ You may have this information already from the referral. Check with the patient.  ∙ List medicines and dose if known, including prescribed, complimentary, and over the counter  medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. RELEVANT MEDICAL and PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY\r\n∙ You may have this information already from the referral. Check with the patient. \r\n∙ List conditions and dates if applicable: e.g. diabetes, thyroid problems",
    ", allergies, Crohn’s Disease,  IBS, Eating Disorder, depression, substance abuse, self harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n∙ Note any hospital admissions, NHS or Private for treatment of eating disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PREVIOUS DIETETIC CONTACT\r\nHave you been referred to a dietitian before? \r\nIf yes: who, where and when. \r\nIt is useful to know if the patient has previously seen a dietitian & how they felt about this experience.  Note date of prior treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. PATIENT’S UNDERSTANDING OF REFERRAL\r\nIt is useful for t",
    "he dietitian to gauge the awareness & denial of current difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. PATIENT’S ACCOUNT OF ILLNESS\r\nTo establish a rapport, it is useful to give an opportunity for the patient to tell their “story”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. CLINICAL / PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS\r\nClinical observation is important in the assessment. \r\nRecord symptoms which are relevant, either by ticking the checklist and/or making brief notes on the  assessment sheet.  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. FAMILY / MEMBERS / HOME / LIVING SITUATION\r\nIt is important t",
    "o identify family situation & networks. Include any Child Protection issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. SOCIAL SITUATION\r\n It is important to identify social networks & any changes as a result of their Eating Disorder.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. DIET HISTORY current\r\nInitial Assessment – Inpatients \r\nA more detailed history is required to avoid Re-feeding Syndrome. (See Refeeding Syndrome &  Management section) \r\nInitial Assessment – Outpatient \r\nCompleting a full Diet History at first appointment is unlikely. \r\nBe mindful ",
    "about getting information regarding weekend/shift work/schooling. \r\nOnce you have established a good rapport with the patient, you may find it helpful to explore ‘The Perfect  Day’. \r\nPerfect Day \r\nA good way of wording this question is as follows: \r\n\"Imagine you could plan tomorrow and it turned out to be a 'perfect day' eating-wise, a day where you went  to bed at night feeling very content, what would you eat tomorrow?\"  \r\nThis establishes what the patient sees as being a good day for them an",
    "d can help assess their motivation  to change.\r\nEstimated intake: calories/day   protein/day  fluid/day \r\nEstimated requirements:  \r\ncalories/day \r\n protein/day \r\n fluid /day\r\n(See Energy Requirements and Weight Restoration section)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. MEALS\r\nThis information will give you a deeper understanding of the extent of the Eating Disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. EATING DISORDERED BEHAVIOUR \r\nComments\r\nIn this section, details of other unhelpful eating disorder behaviours and dietary rules can be recorded. ",
    "It is  useful to have patients identify these behaviours for themselves using different self-assessment handouts  (see Examples of eating disorders behaviours for more information).\r\nOCD Habits\r\nThese behaviours can have a detrimental effect on recovery e.g. hand  washing\r\nDietary Rules\r\nOften patients with eating disorders have ‘dietary rules’ that they follow.  Some of these rules they may be very aware of, but others may only  become apparent when they try to make changes to their dietary int",
    "ake. \r\nIt can be difficult for a patient to identify their own dietary rules as often  they are unaware of them. A good way of describing a dietary rule is a  rule they follow that they would not expect anyone else to follow. For  example ‘I can’t eat carbohydrate after 6pm’ \r\nOften patients cannot remember where their dietary rules came from.  \r\nThis does not matter as if they follow the same routine for a while, the  need to continue doing so can become quite rigid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs there can fre",
    "quently be barriers to changing their food intake, a  useful exercise is to try to help the patient identify what their dietary rules  are. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. EATING DISORDERED BEHAVIOUR and ATTITUDES TO FOOD\r\n∙ Identify & explore further eating disorder behaviours. \r\nThis information will help you identify treatment goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. PREVIOUS EATING HISTORY (from childhood onwards)\r\n∙ How would patient describe their eating pattern as a child/ before onset of problems? Was patient  a “fussy” eater? Br",
    "iefly describe variety / range/regularity of foods taken at this time. \r\n∙ How did eating habits change as problems started to develop? \r\n∙ Were any specific diets followed? When did this occur?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. FAMILY HISTORY OF WEIGHT, DIETING and EATING DISORDERS\r\n∙ Identify attitudes to weight & dieting within the family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. WEIGHT HISTORY\r\nIt is important to gather a full weight history for inpatients, but not necessary at the first appointment for  outpatients. \r\nTarget weight range for y",
    "oung people. (See Children and adolescents section) \r\nFor adolescents there is no general consensus on what the ideal target weight range should be. While  local policies may differ, it should be set in treatment on an individual basis taking into account of pubertal  stage, prior growth centiles, and height, gender and age. \r\nThe goal weight range is a 'moving target' and normal growth and development requires a recalculation of  this every 6 months. \r\nThe BMI-for-age and Growth Chart (Child Gr",
    "owth Foundation) provide a useful resource of normal height  and weight data for children and adolescents in the UK. \r\nThe goal weight range should be at which normal physical and sexual development occurs - for girls this  is the weight at which menstruation and ovulation are restored bearing in mind if post/premenarcheal. For  an adolescent boy - whether or not his growth and development is complete. \r\nAs guidance, this usually falls within a range between the 25th and 75th centile on the BMI-",
    "for-age chart.  From this the weight range (in kg) can then be calculated. \r\nTIMELINE It may be useful to plot a time line of approximate weights during assessment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. EXERCISE HISTORY\r\n∙ Identify level of planned or unplanned activity. \r\n∙ Identify if over exercising is a coping strategy. \r\nThis will help you estimate energy requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. MOTIVATION TO CHANGE\r\n  \r\nUse tools to explore motivation / readiness to change as this will determine your treatment plan. \r\n5 stages – Die",

Contemplation – Acknowledgement of a problem, but not of a need to change (not a serious  matter). \r\n3. Preparation – Acknowledgement of the need to change but not ready yet. ‘I know I am too thin  but I’m terrified and not ready yet’. \r\n4. Action – wants help to change. ‘I’ve got to do this, I’m really ill’. \r\n5. Maintenance – wants help to maintain. Started eating and is",

PATIENTS AIMS OF CONTACT\r\nWhat does the patient hope to achieve from this dietetic intervention?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. AGREED TREATMENT PLAN\r\nThe Treatment plan has to be completed by the end of the Assessment period \r\nUnder this section you should document: \r\n∙ Your greatest concern regarding the patient? \r\n∙ Aims of dietetic contact wi",

    "ng with severe mental illness,  learning disabilities and/or autism when compared to the general population;  average life expectancy is 15-20 years shorter. The higher rates of obesity found in  these groups poses a particularly significant physical health inequality with an  increased risk of several chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n2 | Managing a healthy weight in adult secure services – practice guidance \r\n\r\nThe prevalence of overweight and obesity in adult secure settings is greater than in  the genera",
    "l population (~80% vs ~60%) and service users appear to be at  increased risk of weight gain when detained. Public Health England’s report on  obesity in secure settings shows the prevalence of obesity in service users in  secure care is two to three times higher than the general population. The problem  appears to be much more severe in women’s units. Significant weight gain can be  identified within 12 weeks of starting antipsychotic treatment: in the EUFEST study  of service users in their fi",
    "rst episode of psychosis, 65% of service users had weight  gain of ≥7% of initial body weight at one-year (Fleischhacker et al, 2005). \r\nWhile many secure settings have been taking approaches to support service users  to achieve and maintain a healthier weight, there has been no specific national  guidance to support these changes. As highlighted in the Rethink Mental Illness  report: “there are specific characteristics of secure settings that make it difficult for  people to make healthier choi",
    "ces, and which therefore contribute towards weight  gain”. \r\nThere are NICE guidelines for treatment of obesity; however, service users in  secure hospitals experience a number of different issues that make it necessary to  adapt NICE guidelines specifically to suit this population. NICE guidelines suggest  that service users should demonstrate an active engagement in diet, exercise and  other lifestyle interventions to reduce weight before medical treatment is  considered. This is very difficul",
    "t to achieve in the secure services due to the severe, chronic nature of mental disorder, the treatments received, and the restrictions on  freedom of movement. \r\nThis guidance aims to address the specific issues and outlines ‘what good looks  like’ for adult secure settings. Within secure settings it recognises the need to  balance autonomy and reasonable restrictions to protect from harm. Managing a  healthy weight and its complications are major public health concerns. Given the  high prevale",
    "nce of these issues within adult secure services, the guidance tries to  be both reasonable and proportionate in its approach. \r\nIt is important that at a local level consideration is given to how these guidelines are  implemented and that approaches should be co-produced to ensure maximum  collaboration and ownership for all those involved. It is important to seek to address  the issue of stigma surrounding obesity and the emphasis throughout the guidance\r\n\r\n3 | Managing a healthy weight in adu",

This guidance is presented in a way that services can select  areas that they need to work on and prioritise which aspects they need to address. \r\n2.1 Building on existing standards \r\nThis guidance aims to support, as well as build on, existing standards and priorities  that apply to adult secure services and aligns with the ambitions within the NHS  Long Term Plan. \r\n• Hospital Food Standards: The NHS Standard Contract sets out the  responsibility for providers to comply ",
    "with the five mandatory food  standards,1 and to develop and maintain a hospital food and drink strategy.  The hospital food standards cover food provision for both service users and  staff/visitors (including retail).

This scheme was also incorporated into the 2018/19:  Healthy food for NHS staff, visitors and service users CQUIN. \r\n• ‘Standards for Forensic Mental Health Services: Low and Medium  Secure Care 2019/20’: The standards devel",

Having a senior leader to champion and help steer the work will help. \r\n• Working across disciplines and the local system: To help embed  change it is important to involve multiple disciplines across the providers as  well as working with the external system, to ensure continuity of care and  messages for the service user.

It may have transient gastrointestinal and mild neuropsychiatric side effects (anxiety, insomnia,  irritability).

Resear",
    "ch suggests that those who have complications such as diabetes, positive health  benefits are seen with 5 percent weight loss and these gains accelerate when there is 10 percent weight loss. In such  service users, it’s reasonable to consider pharmacotherapy more pro-actively as it is known to induce weight loss in one in  three service users treated. Moreover, the response is usually evident in first 12-16 weeks of starting treatment. Those who  do not lose weight in first 12 weeks are unlikely",

For those where  medication causes more than 5% weight loss, the medication should be continued indefinitely. \r\n• Bariatric surgery consistently results up to 25 percent weight loss. This should be considered in service users who have severe complications especially if treatment with medication is ineffective. Complications that respond best to bariatric  surgery best include type 2 diabetes, liver disease, severe sleep apnoea, severe ",

    "HS Improvement  \r\nPublication approval reference: PAR121\r\nEFFECTS OF STARVATION ON BEHAVIOUR\r\n\r\nThere is a great similarity between many of the experiences observed in victims of semi-starvation and those found in individuals with anorexia or bulimia.\r\n\r\nOver 30 years ago Ancel Keys and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota studied the effects of starvation on behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe experiment involved restricting the calorie intake of 36 young, healthy, psychologically normal men who had vol",
    "unteered for the study as an alternative to military service.  During the first 3 months of the experiment they ate normally while their behaviour, personality and eating patterns were studied in detail.  During the next 6 months, the men were restricted to approximately half of their former food intake and lost, on average, 25% of their original body weight.  This was followed by 3 months rehabilitation, during which the men were gradually re-fed.  Although their individual response varied, the",
    " men experienced dramatic physical, psychological and social changes as a result of the starvation. \r\n\r\nAttitudes and Behaviour Related to Eating\r\n\r\nOne of the main results of starvation was a dramatic increase in the pre-occupation with food.  The men found concentrating on their usual activities increasingly difficult, since they were always thinking about food and eating.  In fact, food became a main topic of conversation, reading and daydreams.  Many of the men began reading cookbooks and co",
    "llecting recipes.  Some developed a sudden interest in collecting coffee pots, hot plates and other kitchen utensils.  One man even began rummaging through garbage cans with the hope of finding something that he might need.  This general tendency to hoard has been observed in starved patients with anorexia and even in rats deprived of food.  Despite little interest in cooking before the experiment, almost 40% of the men mentioned cooking as part of their post-experiment plans.  For some, the fas",
    "cination was so great that they actually changed occupations after the experiment: three became chefs, and one went into agriculture.\r\n\r\nDuring starvation, the volunteers’ eating habits changed drastically.  The men spent a lot of their day planning how they would eat their prescribed food.  Much of their behaviour served the purpose of delaying their eating and savouring their food.  The men often ate in silence and devoted total attention to eating.\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota subjects were often caught ",
    "between wanting to gulp their food down hungrily and consume it slowly so that the taste and smell of each bite would be fully appreciated.  Toward the end of starvation, the men would take almost two hours to eat a meal which previously they would have eaten in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nThe men demanded that their food be served hot, and they made unusual creations by mixing food together.  There was a huge increase in the use of salt and spices.  The intake of coffee and tea increased so dramati",
    "cally that the men had to be limited to nine cups per day.\r\n\r\nDuring the 12 week rehabilitation stage, most of these attitudes and behaviours continued.  For a small number of men these became even more apparent during the first six weeks of re-feeding:\r\nIn many cases the men were not content to eat “normal” menus but persisted in their habits of making fantastic concoctions and combinations.  The free choice of ingredients stimulated “creative” and “experimental” playing with food…licking of pl",
    "ates and neglect of table manners.\r\n\r\nBulimia\r\n\r\nDuring the starvation, all of the volunteers reported increased hunger; some appeared to be able to tolerate the experiment fairly well, but for others it created intense distress or even became unbearable.  Several men failed to follow their diets and reported episodes of bingeing followed by purging.  While working in a grocery store,\r\n\r\n[one subject] suffered a complete loss of will power and ate several cookies, a sack of popcorn, and 2 overri",
    "pe bananas before he could “regain control” of himself.  He immediately suffered a severe emotional upset, with nausea, and upon returning to the laboratory he vomited…He experienced self-loathing, and expressed disgust and self-criticism.\r\n\r\nAfter about 5 months of rehabilitation, the majority of the men reported some normalisation of their eating patterns.  More than 8 months after renourishment a few men were still eating abnormal amounts. One man still reported consuming “about 25% more than",
    " his pre-starvation amount. Once, he started to reduce but got so hungry he could not stand it.”\r\n\r\nEmotional Changes\r\n\r\nAlthough the subjects were psychologically healthy before the experiment, most experienced significant emotional changes as a result of semi-starvation.  Some reported short term, and others, longer term periods of depression, with an overall lowering of the threshold for depression (so becoming depressed quite easily).  Occasionally happiness was observed, but this was certai",
    "nly followed by “low periods”.  Although the men had quite easy-going natures prior to starvation, this was replaced by irritability and frequent outbursts of anger.  For most subjects, anxiety became more evident.  As the experiment progressed, many of the formerly even-tempered men began biting their nails or smoking because they felt nervous.  Apathy became common, and some men who had been quite meticulous neglected various aspects of their personal hygiene.  Most of the subjects experienced",
    " periods during which their emotional distress was quite severe, and all showed the symptoms of “semi-starvation neurosis” described above.\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded from observation, as well as personality testing, that the individual emotional response to semi-starvation varies considerably.  Some of the volunteers in Keys experiment seemed to cope relatively well, and other showed extraordinary disturbance following weight loss and undereating.  Since the emotional difficulties in the Minnesota ",
    "volunteers did not immediately reverse themselves during rehabilitation, it may be assumed that the abnormalities were related more to body weight than to short-term calorie intake.  It would be fair to say that many of the psychological disturbances found in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa may be the result of the semi-starvation process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial and Sexual Changes\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary impact of semi-starvation were reflected in the social changes experienced by most of the vol",
    "unteers.  Although originally quite social, the men became progressively more withdrawn and isolated.  Humour and the sense of friendship decreased steadily within growing feelings of social inadequacy,\r\n\r\nSocial initiative especially, and sociability in general, underwent a remarkable change.  The men became reluctant to plan activities, to make decisions, and to participate in group activities…They spent more and more time alone.  It became “too much trouble” or “too tiring” to have contact wi",
    "th other people.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers’ social contacts with women also declined sharply during semi-starvation.  Those who continued to see women socially found that their relationships became strained.  These changes are illustrated in the description from one man’s diary,\r\n\r\nI am one of about 3 or 4 who still go out with girls.  I fell in love with a girl during the control period but I see her only occasionally now.  It’s almost too much trouble to see her even when she visits me in the lab.  It",
    " requires effort to hold her hand.  Entertainment must be tame.  If we see a show, the most interesting part of it is contained in scenes where people are eating.\r\n\r\nOne subject graphically stated that he had “no more sexual feeling than a sick oyster”.\r\n\r\nDuring rehabilitation, sexual interest was slow to return.  Even after 3 months the men judged themselves to be far from normal in this area.  However, after 8 months of renourishment, virtually all of the men had recovered their interest in s",
    "ex.\r\n\r\nCognitive Changes\r\n\r\nThe volunteers reported impaired concentration, alertness, comprehension and judgement during semi-starvation.\r\n\r\nPhysical Changes\r\n\r\nAs the 6 months of semi-starvation progressed, the volunteers showed many physical changes, including the following: gastrointestinal discomfort, decreased need for sleep, dizziness, headaches, hypersensitivity to noise and light, reduced strength, oedema (an excess of fluid causing swelling), hair loss, decreased tolerance for cold tem",
    "peratures (cold hands and feet) and parasthesia (abnormal tingling or pricking sensations, especially in the hands and feet).  There was an overall decrease in metabolism (decreased body temperature, heart rate and respiration).\r\n\r\nDuring rehabilitation, metabolism again speeded up,\r\n\r\nThose subjects who gained the most weight became concerned about their increased sluggishness, general flabbiness, and the tendency of fat to accumulate in the abdomen and buttocks.\r\n\r\nThese complaints are similar",
    " to those of many patients with bulimia and anorexia as they gain weight.  Besides their understandable fear of weight gain, they often report “feeling fat” and are worried about getting distended stomachs.  However, the body weight and relative body fat of the Minnesota volunteers had begun to approach the pre-experiment levels after just over a year.\r\n\r\nPhysical Activity\r\n\r\nIn general, the men responded to semi-starvation with reduced physical activity.  They became tired, weak, listless, apat",
    "hetic and complained of lack of energy.  Voluntary movements became noticeably slower.  However, according to the original report:\r\n\r\nSome men exercised deliberately at times.  Some of them attempted to lose weight by driving themselves through periods of excessive energy in order either to obtain increased bread rations…or to avoid reduction in rations.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the practice of some patients with anorexia or bulimia, who feel that if they exercise strenuously, they can allow themse",
    "lves a bit more to eat.\r\n\r\nSignificance of the Starvation Study\r\n\r\nAs is obvious from the above description of the Minnesota experiment, many of the symptoms that might have been thought to be specific to anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa are actually the result of starvation.  These are not limited to food and weight, but extend to virtually all areas of psychological and social functioning.  Since many of the symptoms that have been thought to cause these disorders may actually result from u",
    "ndernutrition, it is absolutely essential that weight be returned to “normal” levels in order that emotional disturbances be accurately addressed.\r\n\r\nThe profound effects of starvation also illustrate the tremendous adaptive capacity of the human body and the intense biological pressure on a person to maintain a relatively consistent body weight.  The starvation study illustrates how a person becomes more orientated towards food when starved and how other pursuits important to his/her survival b",
    "ecome secondary to the primary drive toward food.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasised that following the months of rehabilitation, the Minnesota volunteers did not sky rocket into obesity.  On average they gained back their original weight plus about 10%.  Then, over the next 6 months, their weight gradually declined.  By the end of the follow-up period, they were approaching their pre-experiment weight levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n“Handbook of Psychotherapy for Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia”.\r\n\r\nGarner and",

    "nduct work within their own  settings and to share their findings. \r\nAdditional menus and special diet provision  \r\nIt is important to note that specialist diets and additional menus, as per guidance in the BDA  Nutrition & Hydration Digest, still need to be provided in mental health and learning disability  settings. All sites should consider the need for:  \r\n● Texture modified meals at levels 3 - 6 as described by the International Dysphagia Diet  Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) \r\n● Finger ",

When such  needs arise, clinical dietitians, food service dietitians and catering teams will need to work  together to identify suita",
    "ble menu options. \r\nFurther guidance on all of these specialist diets and additional menus can be found in Chapter  12 of the BDA Nutrition and Hydration Digest65.  \r\nIt is also important to note that service users need to be asked upon admission if they have  any dietary requirements, to allow for the correct menus to be provided to them. This is also  an essential step to ensure any allergies, food hypersensitivities and specialist dietary needs  can be highlighted straight away to avoid clini",
    "cal incidents. The service user should be shown  all relevant menus that apply to their specialist nutritional needs so that arrangements can be  made in a timely manner. It is important to engage the service user in meal choice from special  diet menus to prevent food wastage and ensure they are fully aware of the food provision  available to them. Where service users are unable to indicate their dietary needs due to their  mental health presentation or learning disability, clinical staff shoul",
    "d seek this information  urgently from families, carers and staff from previous settings attended. \r\n65 BDA (2023)\r\nMenu fatigue  \r\nAverage length of stay in mental health settings is 39 days66, compared to 8.3 days in acute  settings67, but many service users may be inpatients for several months or even years. For  example, in December 2024, 52% of inpatients with a learning disability and/or autism had  had a total length of stay over two years68.  \r\nWith long admissions, menu fatigue can cont",
    "ribute to service users’ feelings of loss of control,  and increase the likelihood of service users turning to less healthy options such as takeaways.  Trusts should consider the feasibility of a four-week menu cycle (or longer) to reduce  repetition. The use of special theme nights and menu reviews which take service user  feedback into account can help to prevent service user frustration with the meals offered.  \r\nIt is important to acknowledge that the general preferences of service users on ",
    "different wards  (eg young people, older adults) are likely to be very different from one another, as well as  variation of course in individual service user preference. \r\nTherapeutic mealtimes \r\nStaff eating together with service users from the same menu is often considered to be a  beneficial part of therapeutic treatment in mental health, eating disorders and learning  disabilities settings. This can support a positive ward culture and normalise healthy eating  patterns, for example. Where th",
    "is is required, ward staff should communicate with catering  departments to ensure that provision is adequate and that funding is available. \r\nMenu presentation  \r\nIn mental health and learning disability settings it is important that menus are presented in a user-friendly format that is easy for service users to access and understand. Expert clinical  staff (such as dietitians, occupational therapists and speech & language therapists) and  service users should be sought when designing menus. Fo",
    "r example, it may be felt that for  some service users menu coding is overwhelming, and that it is more helpful for staff to guide  service users to make healthier or higher energy choices (visibility of coding may also be  considered inappropriate for people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa).  \r\nThe use of pictorial menus is recommended to ensure service users know how a meal will be  presented to them and can easily understand what the dish they have chosen is. It may also  be us",
    "eful for the service user to know via symbols or additional text whether the dish contains  meat and if so which type of meat. Pictorial menus are helpful for people with low reading  literacy and a variety of cognitive and communication difficulties.  \r\nThe mealtime environment  \r\nIn contrast to most acute settings, people in mental health and learning disability inpatient  settings typically will not be served food in bed, but in communal dining rooms.

Their  presence is also required to ensure service user safety, by checking that any special dietary  needs such as allergies or texture modification is adhered to.  \r\nCare should be taken to ensure that mealtime environments are positive places to eat, and  are differentiated from clinical areas. Sensory needs and differences (such as the need for  distraction or absence of distraction) should be taken into account. \r\n  \r\nOrdering systems  \r\nProgress ",
    "towards digital meal ordering systems is specified in the National Standards for  Healthcare Food and Drink69 and has many benefits for providers and service users. However,  the practical usage of such systems in mental health and learning disability settings may need  to remain flexible. For example, it may be felt that there is a therapeutic benefit for some  service users of ticking their choices on a paper menu, as this provides an opportunity for  independence; staff members could then ent",
    "er this onto the digital system. Other service users  may find ordering via an electronic device helpful, where this is safely available. \r\nConsideration should also be given to the timing of ordering and how far in advance of the  mealtime this takes place. Ordering too far in advance may increase service user confusion  and increase food waste. To promote a normalised eating experience and reduce food waste  due to changing minds at time of service, the ordering should be taken as close to the",
    " mealtime  as possible. On the other hand, some cohorts of service users may find daily ordering  stressful, or benefit from the routine and structure of planning meals a week in advance. Food  service dietitians and catering teams should consider what is practically feasible, and seek the  input of clinical teams and service users to establish the most appropriate system for the  service.  \r\n69 NHS England (2022)\r\nFurther considerations \r\nNutrition and mental health \r\nTraditional dietary patter",
    "ns such as the Mediterranean diet have been shown to be protective  of mental health and to reduce the risk of depression. It is important to note, however, that this  evidence typically relates to maintenance or protection of cognitive function, as opposed to  the treatment of mental illness70 71. Further research is needed to understand how diet may  support the treatment of mental illness in inpatient environments, and food service dietitians  have an important role to play in developing this",
    " potentially important treatment option. \r\nNutrition and capacity \r\nClinical dietitians may be involved in assessing service users’ mental capacity in relation to  diet and health72. Food service dietitians and catering teams may be called on to support  individual care plans resulting from such assessments and should aim to be as flexible as  possible. \r\nAcute settings \r\nWhere people with severe mental illness, an eating disorder or learning disability are admitted  to general acute settings fo",
    "r treatment, and the provision of food and drink is problematic, food  service dietitians and catering teams from specialist settings should support acute teams with  handovers for individual service users and/or general advice wherever possible.  \r\nFood service dietitians and catering teams in acute settings should aim to support clinical  teams, for example considering where possible menu formats (eg larger font, pictorial menus),  eating environments and food provision. Some service users wil",
    "l have health passports, and  it may be helpful for relevant aspects of these to be shared with catering teams.  \r\nStaff & service user safety  \r\nCatering teams and clinical teams will need to work together to design and adhere to locally  appropriate policies and procedures around safety, balancing risk to staff and service users  with opportunities for the promotion of service user rehabilitation and independence, and  minimising restrictive practice (for more on this, see below). \r\nConsiderat",

This may include ensuring that  staff responsible for taking the service user's meal order are using the menu and also referring  to picture menus to help ensure service users are fully aware of the meal items they are  choosing.  \r\nTakeaways and food",
    " from external sources \r\nAs discussed elsewhere in this document, it is common for service users to access takeaways  and foods from external sources, and this can impact the effectiveness of clinical care plans  seeking to minimise weight gain.  \r\nThe Care Quality Commission state that blanket restrictions should be avoided, and that  everyone in health and care has a role to play in reducing the use of restrictive practices; this  does not simply relate to the more extreme forms of restrictive",
    " practice such as restraint. ‘This  includes, for example, not being able to make hot drinks after a specified time, or denying  people access to … food due to a lack of staff or time’73.  \r\nFood service dietitians and catering teams should collaborate with multidisciplinary clinical  teams alongside service user input, to consider how they can best support efforts to encourage  a healthy food culture on the ward and a measured approach to takeaways. This may include  menu planning incorporating",

    "learning disability sites may have a different daily routine  compared to acute care hospitals. Therefore, the food provision may differ slightly in terms of  increased risk of menu fatigue, increased or varied snack provision, the types of special diets  required and the potential for adjusted portion sizes.  \r\nOther topics which may be particularly relevant for mental health and learning disability sites  to consider when contributing towards a tender may include:  \r\n● If using a bought-in mea",

Key changes included  reducing higher energy options and increasing healthier and plant-based options. Menu  uptake, service user feedback and plate waste were monitored daily for 12 weeks. The pilot  menu received positive service use",

An MSc dietetics student was supported to complete a  dissertation to assess the potential clinical impact of the menu pilot. A significant improvement  in dietary risk factors associated with cardioprotective effects was observed, including:  reduced energy intake, reduced red meat consumption, reduced intake of foods high in  saturated fats, free sugars and salt, and increased consumption of Medit",

As a result, ‘source of fibre’ coding has been added to menus to highlight those  products that are higher in fibre and to encourage the consumption of fruits as a snack and  vegetables sides with main meals.

    "the specialist eating disorders dietitian. \r\nFamily based treatment (FT-AN) is the evidence based treatment model for young people with AN and therefore dietitians should be focusing their treatment programmes to align with FT-AN. Dietitians working in eating disorders must have an understanding of the underlying dynamics and be aware of their professional boundaries when treating these complex patients. It is important to highlight the importance of a synergy between psychological and nutrition",
    "; without psychological understanding and support, nutritional rehabilitation is likely to be ineffective. Conversely, malnutrition will impact cognitive function and behaviour. \r\nThe authors are drawn from practicing paediatric and adolescent specialist eating disorders dietitians from around England, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Additional advice was sought from family therapists and psychiatrists. Each author focused on their specialist area of interest within eating disorders. T",
    "he importance of evidence based practice in a field with limited research has demanded a thorough review of available evidence and has also drawn upon clinical experience and practice. \r\nThroughout the guidelines recommended competencies have been highlighted to emphasise key points within sections ensuring the dietitian can focus their understanding and learning. Although these guidelines focus on the dietitians role in treating and managing AN the dietitian must align with the multidisciplinar",
    "y team and should not be treating young people with AN as sole practitioners.\r\n6 \r\nIntroduction \r\nAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe chronic mental health disorder associated with negative outcomes and with the highest mortality of all psychiatric disorders (1). AN is defined as maintaining a weight below a healthy range by restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, gender, developmental trajectory, and physical health.",
    " Additionally, AN is commonly linked with other comorbid psychological conditions including: depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; obsessive-compulsive disorder; and personality disorders (2). \r\nThe peak onset for AN diagnosis in females in the United Kingdom is between 15 and 19 years with an incidence rate of 0.2% of the population (3). The timing of the peak onset during adolescents is problematic in that it is also a time when energy requirements essential for pubertal growth spurt are at",
    " their peak. The combination of high energy requirements, nutritional restriction and excessive exercising lends itself to a rapid deterioration in health, particularly during vulnerable periods of brain development and physical growth, resulting in potentially permanent physical and psychological consequences (4). \r\nNutritional intervention is an important component in the treatment of eating disorders and the dietitian is therefore an essential member of the multidisciplinary team, especially ",
    "in the presence of other co-morbidities such as coeliac disease, food allergies and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Dietitians should not treat eating disorders as sole practitioners and must work within a multidisciplinary team (5). \r\nScreening and diagnosis \r\nPaediatricians and general practitioners often refer young people with a history of weight loss to the dietitian. It is therefore not unusual for dietitians to be the first health care professionals to identify or question a possible eating dis",
    "order. \r\nMedical \r\nAlthough medical investigations may be necessary to rule out organic aetiology responsible for weight loss or food avoidance, eating disorders are much more common than most differential diagnoses for weight loss: hyperthyroidism, Type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease or neoplastic disease (tumour). Amenorrhoea may result from ovarian or pituitary disease, or following use of the contraceptive pill. Clinical assessment should focus on determining the sev",
    "erity of malnutrition as well as possible causes, and should include hydration status, temperature, muscle wasting and cardiovascular status, with particular attention to heart rate and orthostatic blood pressure. The sit up, squat, stand test is a useful clinical sign to monitor the clinical status of malnourished patients (5). \r\nClinical features \r\nAN is a psychiatric disorder that predominately affects females. It varies in severity, with extreme nutritional restriction accompanied by other a",
    "ssociated behaviours such as binge eating, self-induced vomiting, purging, over-exercising and self-harm (6). The cognitive distortion associated with AN results in dieting behaviour and an intense fear of weight gain\r\n7 \r\nand fatness. Generally there is no loss of appetite, but satisfaction in feeling ‘empty’ and hunger overrides the need to eat, and weight loss is viewed as an achievement; thus sufferers have limited desire to change (7). \r\nIdentifying an eating disorder in the early stages is",
    " difficult due to the deceptive nature of the disease, especially when presentation is atypical - a lack of awareness that AN can occur in children and boys historically led to a delay in referral, diagnosis and treatment (8) . Clinical signs of AN include: \r\nWeight loss \r\nIn AN body weight is maintained at least 15% below that expected. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of underweight is a percentage body mass index (%mBMI) below 85% (where %mBMI is BMI/median BMI for age and gende",
    "r). For the majority of the population a healthy %mBMI will fall between 95-105% (9, 10). A consequence of low weight is that pubertal development is halted, resulting in either a delay in reaching menarche or secondary amenorrhoea, which can have implications on bone health. Physical signs of poor nutrition and low weight include: sunken cheeks, temporal lobes and eyes; dull thinning hair; lanugo hair; cold extremities and feeling cold; and delayed puberty (11). \r\nAvoidance of food \r\nAvoidance ",
    "of food occurs gradually over time, with subtle restriction of nutritional intake including eliminating snacks, reducing portion sizes, hiding food and missing meals. Furthermore, avoidance of food can transfer into the social setting: the young person will avoid eating out due to a lack of control over food preparation, or because it may interrupt rigid exercise routines or other ‘rules’. Conversely, the young person can be overly involved with food shopping, meal preparation and baking but wil",
    "l avoid eating themselves. Young people with eating disorders will often have an extensive knowledge about the calorie content of food but this is often the limit of their understanding about food and nutrition. It is a common misconception that young people with AN have a good comprehension of nutrition; in fact they are often unable to understand information or interpret it correctly, hence the importance of nutrition education (12). \r\nMorbid preoccupation with weight and/or shape \r\nEnergy den",
    "se foods are avoided because of a fear of gaining weight or a change in body shape that may accompany eating. Girls perceive their stomach and thighs as particularly fat, whereas boys may be more concerned about musculature and are more likely to exercise excessively. \r\nPoor self-esteem \r\nFeelings of ineffectiveness are extremely common and often married with depressive and anxiety features, impaired concentration, critical inner-voice and obsessional symptoms. Social interests decline as young ",
    "people with eating disorders lose weight and most become socially withdrawn. Many of these features reverse with weight gain (11). Perfectionism is a trait that can converge with poor self-esteem, resulting in extreme competiveness, asceticism and the need to please; subsequently young people with AN tend to be high achievers and can be perceived by peers and family as coping with life demands.\r\n8 \r\nCompensatory Behavioural features \r\nThese comprise of behaviours that are executed to ‘un-do’ or ",
    "compensate for the effects of just having eaten. Their purpose is to relieve a feeling of guilt from eating or consuming more calories than intended, to relieve anxiety associated with eating and / or to provide an emotional relief from eating. They are also an attempt to promote weight loss, suppress appetite, induce vomiting or minimise the absorption of food. Several different drugs can be misused including: diet pills, diuretics, laxatives and the drug ipecac to help induce vomiting. The mis",
    "use of drugs is more often seen in bulimic patients. \r\nPurging \r\nPurging involves all forms of self-induced compensation for unwanted consumption of calories plus methods to lower weight by loss of bodily fluids These can include self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretic abuse, or ingestion of thyroid hormone or stimulant-type medication.  \r\nSelf-induced vomiting \r\nSelf-induced vomiting can be executed manually or by using an object. Russel’s Sign is an indication of self-induced vomiting,",
    " presenting as scraped or raw areas of skin on a patient’s knuckles. However, the absence of this sign is not an indication that purging is not occurring as patients may use alternative objects, such as a tooth brush, to help induce vomiting.  \r\nAnother common sign of vomiting is the erosion of tooth enamel, which is particularly marked on the lingual surface of the upper teeth. Other dental changes include increased sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures or a possible increase in dental caries",
    " (13). A second clinical sign is bilateral, painless swelling of the salivary glands particularly the parotid glands on the sides of the face (14). Excessive consumption of fluids is common to help facilitate vomiting or as a way of manipulating body weight. \r\nMisuse of laxatives \r\nA laxative is a medicine that is used to treat constipation by helping the body to stimulate emptying of the bowel. While more common within the bulimic population, laxative misuse is also found across other eating di",

It involves consuming an amount of the drug many times in excess of the manufacturer’s recommendation. Laxatives do not help to aid weight loss in the long term, in the short term weight loss may be temporary as large amounts of water and minerals are being removed. \r\nDiuretics \r\nThe use of diuretics or water pills is another form of purging – they help to increase the freque",

There are complications associated with taking diuretics, including: thirst, muscle cramps or weakness, confusion, fainting, risk of seizures, nausea, vomiting, increased uric acid levels, hypothermia, cardiac complications (irregular heartbeats, arrhythmia, palpitations), muscle paralysis, kidney damage, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities (hypo sodium and potassium). Diuretics can also cause fluid shifts, retention and oedema.\r\n9 \r\nOver-exerc",
    "ising \r\nThis counts as a form of purging when it is done as a compensatory behaviour to control weight rather than for pleasure. Indication that over-exercising may be occurring include:  \r\n- Continued exercise while injured \r\n- Exercising when unwell \r\n- Exercising in bad weather e.g. rain and snow \r\n- The need to increase duration to attain the same benefit \r\n- Refusing to sit down/ inappropriate standing \r\n- Continually walking around the house \r\n- Walking/running up and down the stairs \r\n- F",

Drinking excessive am",
    "ounts of fluid or ‘water loading’ can lead to electrolyte disturbances. Young people should always be weighed at a similar time of the day, in minimal or similar clothing to previous weight measurements, with no shoes, an empty bladder and making sure all pockets are empty. If weight manipulation is suspected, random, unscheduled weight checks may be of benefit. However, these should not be done on a regular basis or else the young person will suspect that this will be done again and continue to",
    " manipulate their weight. \r\nAppetite Suppressants \r\nYoung people with AN may use a variety of substances to help reduce their appetite and feelings of hunger. Often these are products that can be purchased over the counter e.g. stimulants, caffeinated drinks, energy drinks such as Red Bull, or over-the-counter diet pills or nicotine. Excessive use of chewing gum can also cause bloating, stomach ache and have a laxative effect. \r\nInsulin Misuse in Diabetes \r\nDiabulimia is the misuse of insulin ei",

    " family, social and educational life. Therefore, intensive outpatient treatment should be sought if possible. FT-AN can be summarised as an intensive outpatient treatment where parents play an active and positive role. Parents are seen as a resource in treatment, developing methods to restore their malnourished adolescent’s weight. The expectation is that parents take a lead in managing their child’s eating in the early stages of treatment. In most cases, the treatment comprises three phases con",
    "sisting of 15-20 treatment sessions over 6-12months. \r\nWith the therapist families are encouraged to explore how the eating disorder and the interactional patterns in the family have become entangled and how this entanglement has made it difficult for the family to get back on track with their normal developmental course. \r\nWhen deciding whether day patient or inpatient care is most appropriate a number of factors need to be considered including: the young person’s weight; the rate of weight los",
    "s; the medical status; and crucially whether the parents/ carers can support them and keep them from significant harm as an outpatient. Furthermore, in some cases outpatient treatment is just not an option due to the presence of overt systemic issues or strong/ risky AN cognitions and behaviors. \r\nPhase 1: Dietetic engagement, development of therapeutic alliance and restoration of the young person’s weight \r\nClient and family focused approach \r\nAs outlined in the NICE guidelines for eating disor",
    "ders(17), in the first phase the aim is “to establish a good therapeutic alliance with the person, their parents or carers and other family members”. Change cannot happen outside a therapeutic relationship (18). \r\nUniversally, dietetic practice has shifted over time to a client-focused approach. This is an improvement over the traditional medical approach, in which the dietitian is regarded as the expert (in charge of treatment and knowing all). Family focused eating disorder treatment is a two-",
    "way process i.e. looking at how clinicians can be both client and family focused (taking into account aspects of both). \r\nWe should always be aiming to include the young person’s voice and trying to find the right fit with them; in the correct environment a child-centered approach can enhance their motivation to change. However, the dietitian cannot be completely child-focused, because that could inadvertently mean engaging with decisions influenced by the eating disorder.  \r\nTherefore, the exte",
    "nt that the young person will be part of the decision making in their treatment will depend on the severity of their illness.  \r\nEarly in treatment clinicians should “support the parents or carers to take a central role in helping the young person manage their eating and emphasise that this is a temporary role” (17). The dietitian would be using a family focused approach, looking at how they can empower the parents / caregivers to manage the eating disorder, rather than doing the work on behalf ",
    "of the parents. This opens up more possibilities in relation to the support of the young person. Whilst adhering to a client-focused approach, it is important to consider the young person’s individual needs and developmental stage. \r\n11 \r\nIdeally, the young person will participate in developing a plan and therefor agree to follow the plan. If they don’t agree because their anorexic cognitions are too strong, the plan should be phrased in a language that fits them: for example, referencing food a",
    "s medicine; that their parents know what they need and that this is a way of returning to previous interests – such as sports/ drama classes. \r\nFactors that may affect a young person’s readiness to engage include their level of motivation to change, cognitive flexibility, and developmental expectations and limitations (19).  Nutritional psychoeducation with the young person often aids in enhancing motivation in the young person e.g. discussing bone health and risk of fractures; exercise and spor",
    "t goals; brain shrinkage and the desire to do well in school; fertility and future desires. \r\nFurthermore, the dietitian should be looking at enhancing the young person’s relationship with the parents because a robust relationship will be helpful to recovery. So, treatment should have a positive impact on their relationship and encourage the young person to feel that their parents are there for them and fighting the eating disorder as a united team; i.e. developing a shared narrative of parental",
    " care needed to overcome the eating disorder. \r\nIt is important to consider the young person’s capacity to make decisions. There are many analogies to help parents understand that the eating disorder has left their child incompetent to have the age-appropriate food control and that they need to take responsibility. Figure 1 depicts the analogy of the solar eclipse. Here you would ask parents which of these three scenarios resonates with them. It is not unusual for parents not to have the same pe",
    "rspective as each other or with the young person, so the analogy may lead usefully to some conversation about this. \r\nFigure 1: Analogy to establish young person’s capacity to make nutrition based decisions \r\n\r\nAble to distinguish between their \r\npreferences and those of the eating disorder \r\nMiddle ground Slight overlap – approximately \r\n25 % when \r\nunable to \r\ndistinguish \r\npreferences \r\nTotal Eclipse \r\nUnable to \r\ndistinguish \r\nbetween their \r\npreferences and those of the \r\neating disorder\r\n\r",
    "\nIf the young person has capacity to use treatment then you would discuss the eclipse analogy in front of the parents. If the dietitian perceives the session as being dominated by the eating disorder cognitions then he or she may focus on the parents – for example, by asking: Is this your child talking, or the illness. It is important to engage each family member in sessions and make strong efforts to develop rapport or an alliance with each family member (20).  \r\n12 \r\nAn Aligned Approach \r\nThe ",

For example, rather than saying 'You should be ensuring that she is having butter on her toast', making more of an observation 'It sounds like the eating disorder is getting activated when you butter the toast'.\r\n14 \r\nThe following information from the initial sessions is helpful when evaluating the extent of parental empowerment and potential impediments (20): \r\n- What language do the parents / caregivers use at the outset? How confident do th",
    "e parents / caregivers appear and does their confidence match steps they have taken to address their young person’s dilemma? \r\n- How quickly did the family respond once the problem had been identified? - What sorts of barriers were there to acting on the problem of the eating disorder (lack of communication, closeness – e.g., “We don’t really eat meals together”)? - How do parents respond to the directive to take responsibility for refeeding? Do they appear reluctant, resigned, actively against ",
    "or eager to enact this role? - What type of planning behaviour do the parents demonstrate at the end of the session? \r\nDietitians should be aware of the early signs which indicate lack of parental empowerment. These include: \r\n- Parents defer to the young person on decisions related to eating. \r\n- Parents overtly state that they are unable to take over all meals. \r\n- Parents frequently reference alternative forms of treatment. \r\n- Parents ‘demand’ that the clinician provide concrete solutions. W",
    "hile solutions are performed in collaboration with the clinician, some parents / caregivers may become frustrated by the reality that there is no one right way to refeed their child. \r\n- How often are the parents reaching out to the clinician or other members of the treatment team in between sessions? \r\n- What kinds of questions are they identifying/asking? \r\n- Do their questions and concerns reflect an underlying anxiety about their capabilities, confusion about the illness, how to respond or a",
    " lack of confidence in the treatment team or model? \r\n- \r\nStrategies to formulate some of the above dilemmas have been outlined in table 2, which focuses on key skills for dietitians to consider whilst implementing a FT- AN aligned approach.\r\n15 \r\nTable 2: Key skills for dietitians whilst implementing a FT-AN aligned approach (20)\r\nKey Skills for dietitians \r\nExamples\r\nTolerating or managing emotions in the session: \r\nProvide empathy or content for the challenges of renourishment rather than att",

It sets out the ongoing therapeutic relationship and the role of the dietitian. There",
    " is a clear assessment against norms and the resulting problems as a result of dietary restriction are identified and explained to the young person and their carers/families.

    " (BMI) in childhood and throughout puberty. Weight and BMI can be used to track changes in an individual but any comparison of weight against population norms needs to take account of height, sex and age. It is perfectly correct to use BMI centile charts and to report BMI centile in young people. However, for patients below the 0.4th BMI centile, there is a need to quantify the degree of underweight. Using %BMI (BMI/median BMI for age and gender) instantly provides information about a patient’s ",
    "nutritional status without the need to refer to a chart. Furthermore, young people and parents understand the concept of %BMI. \r\nWeight and Height \r\nWeight and height should be measured in kilograms and meters, respectively. Ensure weights are measured in minimal clothes and no shoes, heavy belts, coats or full pockets with keys, change and mobile phones to achieve accuracy. \r\nWeight and height history should be plotted onto a centile chart. A picture of this can be built up from the parent and ",

This is an important visual tool for the parents to see exactly where they are versus where they need to get to. \r\nAfter the consultation you could contact their GP as often historical weights and ",
    "heights are recorded and easily located on their electronic systems. Alternatively, access medical notes, weights and heights or lengths, even from a number of years previously can be useful when plotted on centile charts and match with parental reports, to build up a picture of the young person’s growth and weight history, including identification of any stunting or delayed pubertal growth as a result of the weight loss. \r\nCalculate estimated recent weight loss and compare to Junior Marsipan gu",
    "idance for risk (26).\r\n29 \r\nBody Mass Index (BMI) \r\nThe use of BMI is a valuable pointer to thinness but it is a poor reflector of the young person’s fat reserves. Furthermore, changes in BMI are not a reliable indicator of a change in body fat or muscle mass in this age group (27) and the effect of growth needs to be taken into account. However, it is worth taking into consideration where the young person weight has fallen from and to identify speed of weight loss and weight loss history. \r\nAdd",
    "itional consideration must be sought for the young person who is athletic and competing at high levels in sport, as they may have a BMI within the healthy range as a result of lean tissue. However, the assumed healthy BMI may not correlate with blood pressure and heart rate. Therefore, once again the percentage weight loss should be taken into consideration (28, 29). \r\nPercentage BMI (%mBMI) is useful, does not require a chart to understand progress and calculates to a similar value as to % weig",
    "ht for height. However, %mBMI displays similar downfalls to BMI in regards to some ethnic groups (e.g. Asian young people) which may well be overrepresented in the underweight category. If there is reliable evidence from child health records that that an individual has a height or BMI consistently above or below the 50th centile before anorexia nervosa developing then the target weight may need to be adjusted. \r\n% BMI = (actual BMI/median BMI for age and gender) x 100 \r\nA percentage BMI calculat",

Falsifying Weight \r\nBe aware of fake gains – below are common ways by which this can be achieved – or at least by which the young person may believe they can be achieved: \r\n- Weights in clothes or pockets e.g. metallic change, anything smallish and heavy, rolls of coins taped into underwear, placed in socks or bras. \r\n- Wearing baggy clothes with many thin layers underneath. \r\n- Trying to be weighed in heavy shoes, hoping no one prompts them to be r",

    "ord (taken or verified by parents). Nutritional assessment should expand on the history of food restriction and other self-imposed nutritional ‘rules’ such as exclusion of a food group (fats and/or carbohydrates); vegetarianism/veganism; daily calorie limits; ritualistic behaviours; a limit to the number of spoonful’s of food the young person will allow themselves to eat each day. Additionally, when reviewing young people with binge eating tendencies the dietitian will need to ascertain: \r\n- Wha",
    "t the young person deems a binge to be. \r\n- If there is a specific binge food/food group. \r\n- Specific binge time. \r\n- Cyclical pattern to binges; when meals are missed – loss of control when eats again. \r\nExercise routines should form part of the nutritional assessment and be taken into account when estimating nutritional requirements. An in-depth nutritional assessment also allows the dietitian to gauge the extent of the young person’s nutritional knowledge. \r\nDiet history \r\nA full dietary his",
    "tory taken by a dietitian is a useful tool to assess a young person’s current dietary intake, nutritional inadequacies in terms of calories and protein (32) but also micronutrients such as iron and calcium assessable on first glance. This justification can then form the basis and rationale to a young person for the need of change to eating behaviours and restore nutrition (33). A thorough documentation can also be an important tool to other multi-disciplinary team members working with the young ",
    "person; they may not realise the difference between individual types of restriction and how they differ between young people and thus be useful in other therapy aspects, when understanding belief further down the treatment process. \r\nA detailed diet history should establish if the young person is avoiding red meat, fried food, dairy (high fat) or carbohydrates, or simply counting calories while eating what they like but exercising excessively. Furthermore, a diet history may extract anorexic ‘ru",
    "les’ such as; not eating after 4pm; only eating with a particular utensil; chewing food a specific number of times before swallowing. \r\nA diet history will include what they are eating now - it’s important to establish what was offered or planned versus what was actually consumed. Don’t assume the packed lunch taken to school was eaten, ask the actual question – how much of this did you eat? If the answer is only part of it ask about whether the rest was discarded? \r\nThe diet history should then",
    " go on to clarify what was being eaten in the past, such as 3 months, 6 months and 12 months ago, to identify change over time. Identifying the pattern or types of food cut out and over what time period this had occurred; this will aid you later in the treatment when the time comes to reintroduce forgotten or feared foods.\r\n31 \r\nFurthermore, the dietitian may be able to correlate specific times of weight loss to specific changes in intake.

    "s they impose on themselves on a daily basis. It is important to clarify any food restrictions noticed as a result of this diet history or any in addition. These could include long standing and recent changes and the history of them is important to identify, these include: \r\nKey questions to consider \r\n- Cultural and family beliefs, including beliefs about fasting/food exclusions. \r\n- Likes and dislikes before and after the eating disorder started. \r\n- Foods eaten or avoided, such as high fat, h",
    "igh carbohydrate, processed foods or foods only in a packet which have calorie content on the side. \r\n- Medical condition/allergies requiring special diet – when diagnosed and how? \r\n- Vegetarian and vegan tendencies. \r\n- Eating patterns and routines, such as only eating between 4pm and 7pm or never eating after 8pm or never eating breakfast. \r\n- Other diet knowledge/beliefs – e.g. Atkins, low glycaemic index (GI), milk free, wheat free, blood type, clean diet. \r\n- Any other paternal/maternal/ca",
    "rer opinion on food/diet that is relevant to the young person’s predicament. \r\n- Eating with family or in isolation, and location - bedroom/outside/elsewhere. \r\n- Noticeably fast or slow eating \r\n- Other odd habits – eating with teaspoon, cutting food into tiny portions, adding excessive amounts of vinegar/other condiments to food.\r\n32 \r\n- Any other ritualistic behaviour. \r\n- Bathroom visits straight after or during a meal. \r\nDiet history and fluid intake \r\nAn essential component of the nutritio",
    "nal intake is to estimate how much the young person drinks in the day and compare this to average requirements. This can vary widely between young people and the assessment should identify total volume, frequency and timings (34). This helps identify if large volumes are drunk before a meal, points to the risks of over hydration, and can raise suspicions about the young person abusing fluid as an aid to avoid eating or avoid hunger or aid vomiting. Similarly, some young people restrict fluid out",
    " of a fear of feeling full; most patients with AN equate the feeling of fullness with “feeling fat” (35). \r\nThe type of fluid should also be considered: \r\n- High caffeine content - such as coke and coffee act as an appetite suppressant \r\n- Energy drinks, are high in caffeine but may also be taken to overcome fatigue related to excessive exercising or combat fatigue associated with a hypo-metabolic state (energy conservation). \r\n- Sweeteners/ Sugar free - laxative effect. \r\n- Alcohol consumption ",
    "and indication for B vitamins supplementation (Department of Health, 1991). \r\nHydration status assessment is recommended for those fluid restricting and a feature as part the of Junior Marsipan guidance of risk and admission requirement. \r\nCompetencies: \r\n- Develop an understanding of how issues of under-reporting can be reduced in eating disorder patients when taking a diet history by asking specific questions about food intake i.e. ask if they use a fat spread on their toast rather than assumi",
    "ng that they do.  \r\n- Be aware of the various computer programmes that offer on-line dietary reporting in the adolescent population. \r\nValidity of the diet history \r\nUnder reporting of food intake is more common among overweight and obese individuals and makes it harder to obtain an accurate dietary intake. It is not clear whether under-reporting is specific to certain macronutrients or food generally despite studies been carried out on this subject (36). Some studies have shown that carbohydrat",
    "e is under reported and protein is over reported. A logical explanation for this is that food items that have a negative health image such as sugary and fatty foods are more likely to be under reported. Whereas, those with a positive healthy image such as fruit and vegetables are more likely to be over reported (36). However, we need to be aware that these conclusions cannot be applied to young people with an eating disorder as they have not been studied. \r\n33 \r\nHowever, in eating disorder patie",
    "nts we need to be mindful that both under and over reporting may be evident due to the motivational factors involved. In our society dieting is described as a national obsession which can drive overweight people to under report their food intake and is probably not a reflection of dishonesty.  \r\nThe gold standard for assessing food intake is a 7-day weighed food diary. However, various studies have shown that this type of data collection leads to weight loss due to a reduction in intake or a cha",
    "nge in eating patterns. In one particular study the participants remarked that “…it would be a good way to make someone diet” after completing the study (37): This has obvious drawbacks to young people with eating disorders.  \r\nThe concern is that monitoring food intake may escalate the behaviours in AN and lead to further weight loss. On a practical level the only way to assess accurate food intake is to obtain oral intake in the form of self-reporting and self-monitoring basis. This is done by",
    "/can be achieved by people recording all the food and drink they consume prospectively (food diaries) or retrospectively (24 hr recall and food frequency questionnaires (38).  \r\nDespite the fact that under reporting has been acknowledged for some time, little work has been done to understand this phenomenon. The following statement written over 20 years ago is still relevant today “… dietary intake cannot be estimated without error and probably never will” (37). One thing that is clear is that p",
    "sychological factors play an important role in under reporting in obese individuals rather than a deliberate intention to falsify food records.  In terms of AN, we need to consider that this may play a more significant role than in the obese populations studied.  \r\nIt has been suggested that sufferers of AN include goal-directed behaviour as a reason for food restriction. However, this theory has been challenged, suggesting that there is an element of conditional habitual behaviour responsible f",
    "or restriction rather than just cognitive restraint and disease-related manipulation (39). It is not clear from the results whether this applies to atypical patients with AN or those that engage in food restriction but are not low weight (40).  \r\nIdentifying Eating Behaviours (Family vs AN) \r\nEvery family eats in a way that is unique to them and takes into account cultural background, family and peer influences; meal structure and routines are dependent on work and social routine. Family and fri",
    "ends can significantly and positively influence how someone eats; the presence of a parent at a meal is associated with improved eating (41, 42). \r\nOnce a young person reaches their teenage years they typically eat in a less structured way than before, they snack more often and eat more convenient calorie dense snacks (43). Data also shows that 83% of adolescents consume at least one snack on any given day. Children currently snack almost three times per day, consuming more than 27% of their tot",
    "al daily calories mostly in the form of desserts and sweetened beverages (44). \r\nYoung people with AN experience disruptions to normal eating routines when compared with their peers. Behaviours that relate to AN can be identified by working with their family to\r\n34 \r\nestablish routines that are normal for the family and routines that the young person would have followed in the past. \r\nDeviation from previous and family routines aims to deliberately restrict food volume and/or focus on restrictin",
    "g food types that are perceived as ‘unhealthy’ or undesirable (45). \r\nSuch maladaptive behaviours are a manifestation of AN related concerns and the young person’s anxiety about their weight or shape. Initially behaviour is goal orientated but it becomes habitual over time. A modification in the way a young person manages mealtimes may have several purposes: to prolong meal times; to create a diversion or distraction so that meals do not require completion; or to hide or conceal food to ultimate",
    "ly reduce the kilocalorie and fat content of food but also to reduce or manage distress and high levels of anxiety at meal times, (46). \r\nEating behaviours in those with AN have been objectively assessed using diet histories and clinical studies of observed meals and food choices demonstrating a reduced total calorie and fat intake compared to those without AN (47, 48). Restrictive eating patterns reducing caloric intake, limited dietary variety and preference for consumption of foods of low ene",
    "rgy density are related to poor outcome over time (46, 49). \r\nFood restriction has been termed ‘all consuming, relentless and remarkably stereotyped’ (50). The stereotyped nature of behaviours are characteristic of AN. \r\nCommonly reported examples of food manipulation are listed below: \r\nAvoidance behaviours: \r\n- Chop/ shred food into small pieces \r\n- Hide undesired food under other foodstuffs \r\n- Hide food under table, napkin or other item \r\n- Feed a family pet in a covert way \r\n- Feed a siblin",
    "g or encourage a sibling to hide or eat food for them \r\n- Changing the daily routine to avoid mealtimes, such as making arrangements to meet friends, stay at friends’ houses, settings tasks to coincide with mealtimes \r\n- Studying for prolonged periods of time \r\n- Complaining of illness e.g. tummy bugs \r\n- Complaining that food smells off or deliberate spoiling of food, for example by leaving it out of the fridge to go off; spilling drink on to food; salt spillage. \r\n(51) \r\nWays of reducing the k",

Specific nutritional markers that should be monitored include vitamin B12, folate, zinc, fat soluble vitamins A, D and E, and ferritin (52). In addition, manganese and cholesterol are recommended (53). Although blood markers do contribute to the overall medical picture, results can be a poor reflection of medical condition even",

A detailed assessment of biochemical markers can be found in table 5.  \r\nElectrolytes \r\nElectrolyte disturbances may result from purging behaviours (vomiting, laxative abuse, or diuretic use), with hypokalaemia and hypophosphatemia being the most common (29).  Hypokalaemia is generally found only with significant purging (55). Serum phosphate levels do not reflect total body phosphorous and are ther",

Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia are also known biochemical responses to refeeding (54). Table 5 outlines changes in biochemistry related to purging and Table 6 outlines biochemical parameters in AN. \r\nAcid base disturbance \r\nHypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis is seen with vomiting or diuretic abuse or chronic diarrhoea from",
    " laxative abuse and is likely to be associated with hypokalaemia.  Hypokalaemic hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis is seen with laxative abuse, due to loss of potassium and bicarbonate in the faeces (29, 54). \r\nTable 5: Electrolyte and acid-base changes associated with purging (56) \r\nSalt and water balance \r\nHyponatraemia is commonly the result of water loading but may also be due to the misuse of diuretics or excessive sodium loss due to vomiting/laxative abuse. Medical causes include underlyin",
    "g sepsis, SIADH and Addisons disease. Management is dependent on the cause, so if there is any doubt about aetiology, a full medical assessment is warranted (26, 54). \r\nRenal function \r\nUrea and creatinine are typically low due to reduced protein intake and loss of muscle mass.  However, urea may also be raised in this picture due to catabolism, with a raised creatinine if there is significant muscle breakdown. Urea and creatinine at the higher end of the normal range may also be indicative of d",

Raised levels require medical assessment of hydration status, as assuming dehydration could trigger unwarranted and possibly harmful fluid replacement intervention (26)\r\n37 \r\nSerum proteins \r\nSerum albumin is typically normal even in severe underweight. Hypoalbuminaemia may indicate occult infection, renal losses, liver dysfunction or enteropathy. Hypoalbuminaemia is associated with poor prognosis (54, 55). In cases of hypoalbuminemia, it is important to",
    " correct serum calcium level using standard formulae (55). \r\nLiver Function Tests \r\nAbnormal liver enzymes are common and are usually without symptoms and self-limiting.  However, in rare cases liver failure can occur. Elevated LFTs can occur as a result of starvation but are also seen during the refeeding process – the cause is unknown and tends to be temporary, improving with a more favourable nutritional status (54). \r\nHaematology \r\nChanges in the total blood cell count are regularly observed",
    " in AN patients with almost one third presenting with anaemia or leukocytopenia, while thrombocytopenia is less common at 5-10%. Anaemia presents with normal MCV, MCH, ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B12, while leukocytopenia is characterised by lymphocytopenia or neutropenia. Mild leukocytopenia as seen in AN is more frequent in AN-restrictors rather than in those who purge (36% versus 10%), and there is no significant evidence to suggest an associated infection risk. Severe neutropenia is unc",
    "ommon (57).  \r\nThe severity of anaemia or other hematologic complications may be underestimated due to haemo-concentration as a result of purging behaviours. Morphological changes in the bone marrow, including atrophy of cells and gelatinous bone marrow transformation, are seen in a subset of patients who present with changes to total blood count. Serum iron and ferritin levels tend to be normal in AN due to reduced blood volume, and additionally females experience reduced iron losses due to sec",
    "ondary amenorrhoea. However, an elevated ferritin which normalises after refeeding may be seen, possibly due to the restoration of blood volume with weight regain. All haematological and morphological complications associated with AN disappear rapidly with nutritional repletion (57). Weight loss and pancytopenia should elicit concern and haematological malignancy should be considered as a differential diagnosis (55). \r\nVitamin B12 \r\nA recent study suggests that above normal vitamin B12 levels se",

Initially, the aim is to stop weight loss and build a relationship with the family by devising a realistic achievable meal plan which encourages the young person to engage with treatme",

Once weight loss has slowed and the patient has been able to adhere to the meal plan then energy intake can increase to a weight gaining meal plan. \r\nIt is essential to ascertain whether the patient is at risk of the refeeding syndrome prior to commencing this graded meal plan.

    "e an “idea of the way meals go in the family and where there are obstacles to renourishment, and have an understanding of the ways these issues may contribute to maintaining (or overcoming) the illness” .\r\n42 \r\nKey questions include: \r\n- Who is responsible for which elements of mealtimes (planning, shopping, preparing, portioning)? \r\n- How has the structure and process of meals changed with the development of the eating disorder (e.g. family eating schedule)? \r\n- What is the variety and energy d",
    "ensity of food provided? \r\n- How do the parents respond to their child’s refusal? \r\n(20) \r\nThe dietitian serves as a guide for families in relation to how to manage the barriers to renourishment and navigate the path toward normal eating, which may be difficult to recognise by a family affected by AN. Over time, parents / carers may have developed a reflexive habit of negotiation, which is often exacerbated by their child’s restrictive food preferences and “healthy eating” rules. The goal here w",
    "ould be to help them accept that, at its core, AN is irrational and negotiation is counterproductive (19).  \r\nIt is helpful to enquire about parental alignment so that the dietitian can identify any challenges and support parents in understanding how differences here impact the refeeding process; e.g. by asking the parents / carers questions such as: \r\n- Where do they differ in their view of refeeding and styles? \r\n- Do they acknowledge these differences, work them out together or become entangl",
    "ed in conflict? \r\n- How do they work together in other contexts? \r\n- What new strategies/ skills are they trying?  \r\n- Where do they need to focus their efforts moving forward? \r\n(20) \r\nIt is important for the dietitian to understand areas of parental divide - for example, one parent / carer worrying about their child’s distress while another is focused on dietary intake - in order to increase a sense of shared parental power and effectiveness. Throughout phase 1 the dietitian should suggest adj",
    "ustments or strategies to meet the young person’s evolving nutritional needs. The parents/carers should be assisted in understanding the need for an increased frequency of meals, increased portions, increased caloric density, and consistent meals. Reminding families that food is their child’s medicine can help reorient family members to the importance of consistent nutrition as a means of recovery (19) \r\nIf meals are not completed or left unfinished, dietitians can also assist parents / carers i",
    "n understanding how to adjust subsequent meals or use nutritional supplementation (19). Helping the parents / carers reorient to what their child liked or enjoyed before the eating disorder assists them in externalising around food choices (20). \r\nThe demands of feeding cannot be underestimated; mealtimes can appear to be ever constant, involving the young person to have three meals and two to three snacks daily. It is often necessary to help the parents / carers manage troubleshoot the need for",
    " almost continuous\r\n43 \r\nmeal preparation, and understand the difference between feeding enough to support recovery and what might be considered ‘normal’ eating for child. Parents may have to delegate responsibilities to each other. They may also need assistance to meet the needs of other family members (19). \r\nThe focus around meal times is to try and make the environment safe, predictable, and as calming as possible for all family members. \r\nPoints that may be helpful: \r\n- It is vital that the",
    " family remain aware of the influence of the eating disorder, especially around meal times when the young person can be experiencing overwhelming feelings of anxiety. It can be helpful to plan ahead, for example, knowing who is going to eat with the young person and what is going to be eaten. Some thought should also be given to consistency and the importance of adhering to a routine, together with an agreement on the duration of the meal or snack. Time limits can help minimise eating disorder b",
    "ehaviours. For example, main meals 30-45 minutes, snacks 15 minutes. \r\n- Parents can find it helpful to discuss their expectations with the young person with support from the dietitian. \r\n- It is important for the dietitian to identify irrational beliefs or myths around nutrition which could contribute to maintaining the illness. Dysfunctional thoughts about eating should not be criticised as they are an expression of the eating problem. Parents or carers should encourage their child to eat with",
    "out being influenced by the eating disorder and encourage parents to identify solution -based actions. \r\n- Behaviours around food intake and rituals to control eating - e.g. eating too slowly or too fast, separating fat and sauce from food, drinking a lot during meals, hiding food, cutting food into small pieces - should be gently interrupted. Support the family to work with the young person to challenge anorexic behaviours. \r\n- The dietitian should also model the kind of language they want the ",
    "family to use. Family members should avoid criticism or threats e.g. “Eat for us, aren’t you ashamed about making us so sad?”, “You are killing us with your behaviour. You are so cruel.” “We have made a lot of sacrifices for you. The least you can do is eat this meal.” In difficult situations during meals, empathy should be reinforced, through supportive phases such as, “We know that the process towards recovery is hard, but we are here to help you. Try to do the right thing despite these though",
    "ts.” \r\nIt can be helpful to set some ground rules with the family and young person. The following is a summary from a patient involvement group asking young people with eating disorders what they want at the (table 8) (with permission from the Highfield Unit, Oxford):\r\n44 \r\nTable 8: What young people want at the dinner table? \r\nAvoid negotiation Negotiation around anything food orientated leads to an escalation of the “anorexic voice”. \r\nDon’t give up or give in Young people want to know that no",
    " matter how far they push you, you will hold the boundaries. \r\nAlways be clear and consistent Any hesitation makes the young person feel the need to push boundaries even further. They want \r\nyou to be firm, no matter how far they push you. \r\nBe vigilant If they notice you are not paying attention to what is happening at the table, the urge to hide \r\nfood becomes overwhelming. This makes the \r\nnext meal harder. \r\nAlways encourage, do not threaten Verbal prompts you can use: “try and make a start”",
    ", “keep going.” \r\nConversation General conversation is a great way to distract the young person. Even repeating things such as \r\n“pick up your fork” if someone is struggling. \r\nThey want you to treat every meal or break at the \r\ntable as a fresh start. \r\nAvoid the words “like” or “want” Try not to say things like “Would you like orange or apple juice?” or “Do you want \r\ncornflakes or Weetabix?” Just give a straight \r\nchoice “Orange or apple juice?” \r\nPositives not negatives Young people stated t",
    "hat they find positive statements more helpful than negative ones. For \r\nexample, “Try hard not to mash your peas” is \r\nmore helpful than “Don’t mash your peas”. \r\n\r\nEncourage the smaller voice that holds thoughts of the future \r\nPositive things such as placemats or prompt cards can be helpful. \r\n\r\nCheck how to praise and acknowledge the effort Some young people find it very distressing to be told they have done well. It is okay to find out \r\nthe young person’s belief and ensure that praise \r\nis",
    " given accordingly. E.g. “I acknowledge that \r\nthis meal was tricky for you and that it took a \r\nhuge effort”.\r\n45 \r\nMeal supervision \r\nMeals and snacks should be provided under supervision ideally by someone who can demonstrate empathy and understanding, while setting firm boundaries about what is expected, i.e. how much is to be consumed in a set period of time (62). It is essential that appropriate observations are in place at mealtimes, i.e. consideration is given to who is present at each s",
    "nack and mealtime, for overseeing the consumption of food and fluid and time limits for snacks and meals. Time limits for eating, e.g. 15 minutes per snack and 30 minutes per meal, all need to be agreed. Support and supervision are recommended for one hour after each meal and have been shown to reduce the need for nasogastric feeding (62). Additionally, meal supervision is a good opportunity to explore and discuss normal hunger and feelings of satiety. \r\nAny actions to be taken if a meal is not ",
    "completed need to be agreed and documented in advance, e.g. the volume of supplement to be given to compensate for the incomplete meal. Individual circumstances will help to dictate the exact needs of the young person and any help that may be needed with respect to helping them eat the required amount of food. \r\nPost Meal Support \r\nTypically, after a meal, young people can experience intense feelings of conflict and guilt and be more at risk of compensatory behaviours such as purging or over exe",
    "rcising. ‘Riding the wave’ is an expression often used to relate to the fear and anxiety associated with the distressing feeling of satiety immediately post meal, which invariably subsides within 30- 60mins. It may be useful to think about bathroom use before a meal rather than directly after meals. \r\nTo help overcome this ‘wave of anxiety’ the young person and their families can participate in a seated activity for 45 minutes post meals. Activities involving hand and eye coordination along with",
    " concentration such as jigsaws/ playing cards/ board games or knitting/crochet have been identified as the best distraction activities for people with eating disorders when preoccupied about eating (63). Thinking ahead with the young person and asking them what distractions may be preferred can be useful (64). \r\nUse of Oral Nutritional supplements (ONS) \r\nHigh energy sip feeds can be an invaluable weapon in the dietetic armory for the young person who is struggling to meet the large quantity of ",
    "food required for the growing adolescent. A top up supplement can provide a nutrient rich addition, used as an adjunct to the meal plan, given after meals or snacks. However, there is a very limited research base for the use of ONS in the treatment of young people with AN. \r\nHigh energy and protein supplements available include Fortini Compact multi Fibre; Fortisip Compact (240kcal/ 100ml)/ Ensure 2kcal; Fortisip 2kcal (200kcal/ 100ml) / Pro-cal shot (334kcal/ 100ml). There are different ways of",
    " using ONS but the lack of any real literature on this subject leads to dietitians making clinical judgements on a case by case basis. Ideally patients should be encouraged to restore weight using food, but supplements are sometimes necessary to help with this.(26)\r\n46 \r\nWhen to use: \r\nONS can be a useful way of increasing nutritional intake as they provide a means of giving a calorie, protein and micronutrient dense food to young people who are struggling with dietary intake; especially in adol",
    "escents who have high nutritional requirements for growth and development in addition to catch up growth. ONS should be considered when patients fail to restore weight through a food first approach.  \r\nThe time frame for introducing ONS should be taken on a case by case basis based on clinical risk, progress against expected weight restoration and progress with improving dietary intake.  Some patients may require them following initial dietetic assessment but for others they may not be required ",
    "until later into treatment. \r\nONS should be introduced in a timely manner collaboratively with the young person and their family, fitting supplements around their food intake, meal pattern and eating behaviours. \r\nConsideration of type of supplements to use: \r\nWhen commencing ONS consideration needs to be made regarding religious beliefs and patient’s wishes over vegetarianism. The companies producing the nutritional supplements can provide information on suitable products for these needs. \r\nCon",
    "sideration should be given to the patient’s energy and protein requirements, risk of developing refeeding syndrome, present food intake, bowel habits, preferences and meal pattern when deciding which ONS to use, and how often they should be given. \r\nONS that are nutritionally complete should be used in the first instance. The decision whether to use high energy supplements (such as Ensure TwoCal and Fortisip Compact) or supplements with a greater volume (such as Fortisip Bottle or Ensure Plus) s",
    "hould be made on an individual basis, depending on the patient’s preferences and current food and fluid intake. \r\nConsideration should be given to the physical health of the patient and whether a supplement with a lower osmolality may be better tolerated if the patient suffers with gastro intestinal symptoms. Clinical judgment should be made as to whether these symptoms are a physical result of taking the supplement or anorexia attempting to manipulate nutritional intake. \r\nIt is not recommended",
    " to use a solely carbohydrate based supplement or juice based sip feed (which are high in carbohydrate) due to the possible increased risk of complications associated with refeeding. These supplements will also not contribute to correcting the possible deficiency in essential fats and fat soluble vitamins. \r\nThe use of high calorie/high protein “shot” supplements (e.g. Calogen extra shot or Procal shot) can be used but these are not nutritionally complete and any micronutrient deficiencies in th",
    "e dietary intake needs to be considered. It is not advised to use these supplements when food intake is very poor. \r\nPowder based ONS that are made up with milk in the home are not advised as a first line supplement due to risk of tampering by the young person during preparation. However, these can be used if other supplements are not tolerated. The family should be advised not to allow the young person to prepare these and that they should be taken when supervised to prevent the supplement bein",
    "g tampered with.\r\n47 \r\nMonitoring and discontinuing ONS: \r\nThe young person’s compliance with taking supplements must be closely monitored by the dietitian. \r\nONS should be slowly reduced as the patient’s weight improves. The ONS should be replaced by an increase in dietary intake to ensure adequate nutritional intake continues. \r\nThe dietitian should remain fully involved with the patient and family until ONS are discontinued, expected weight gain has continued or weight has been maintained in ",
    "line with normal growth and development (depending where the patient is in weight restoration) and adequate food intake has been fully restored. \r\nCompetences: \r\n- The dietitian is able to assess nutritional intake and risk factors to make a rational clinical decision to use supplements \r\n- The dietitian should be able to choose the appropriate ONS for the patient and advise on use. \r\n- The dietitian should be able to monitor use of ONS and make a plan to safely discontinue.\r\n48 \r\nTable 9: A pre",

Once parents and the therapy ",
    "team agree that there is a significant shift in the young person’s attitude towards eating, then a ‘food and feeling diary’ can be trialed. \r\nTable 10 gives an example of how to promote return of eating to the young person. For example, at breakfast the parents noted down that a sufficient amount of food was served by the young person and therefore no suggestion/ addition needed. However, at dinner time the parents felt that an insufficient amount of food was served and therefore suggested anoth",
    "er two roast potatoes; what was actually managed was one roast potato. The point here is that, if there are consistent shortfalls in expected intake, and regular battles, it may be that the young person does not have a grasp of what is expected or is not ready/ capable of taking control of the AN. A ‘feeling section’ can be added which can be kept private or discussed with family/ individual therapist.\r\n50 \r\nTable 10: Young person ‘eating and feeling diary’ to ascertain if they are ready to take",

The dietitian has an important role in helping to identify when excluded food is leading to nutritional deficiencies in the diet. There are a number of tools to help young people introduce foods into their diet. Parents should be encouraged to maintain variety in the young person’s food intake. Work should be done collaborat",
    "ively with the family as they will know the young person’s food preferences and dislikes prior to the illness and they know their child best. This history may need to go back several years prior to any eating disorder behaviour becoming apparent. \r\nThe eating disorder team can provide help and support to the family in maintaining a good variety of food intake and challenge feared foods at the best time in treatment. There is a lack of evidence on the best way to introduce “feared” foods and chal",

Alternatively, a list of feared foods can be formulated, which is usually completed ",
    "with parents in conjunction with the young person as it is a difficult task for them, and essential to have trust between all parties. The idea is to gradually introduce the least feared food and work up the list over a defined period of time. It is important to be observant that there is not an increase in compensatory behaviors (i.e. exercise) to counterbalance the addition of feared foods and that if there is, ensure it is time limited. \r\n1.

It can be repeated over time to help the young person recognise improvements that have taken place through treatment. The dietitian should start with the least ‘scary’ food, or the foods most recently excluded, and discuss how it can be incorporated into a family meal; t",

It is important to remember that healthy exercising has many benefits not least its cathartic value.

Additional benefits also includes: strengthening of muscles, management of mood and improved bone health",

Patients with AN lose the ability to experience normal pleasure and tend to avoid rewarding outcomes, most profoundly in food intake. As a result they will probab",
    "ly exercise longer/more intensely in order to achieve the same pleasure (71, 72); this is often referred to as ‘compulsive exercise’ (73). \r\nOnce the team has deemed exercise to be safe based on: cardiovascular health, bone mineral density and %mBMI >85%, then low level activity can be introduced. The recommended guideline for exercise is one hour per day. This may include walking to and from school (20mins/ day) or partaking in PE at school.

It is import",

It is also important to realise that removing this responsibility from the young person who is forced by their illness to over-exercise can come as a relief to them. \r\nOnce the young person has demonstrated that they can continue to gain weight whilst performing low level activity and ma",
    "naging additional snacks to account for the increased energy level then it is viable to consider starting out of school clubs. However, it is important to avoid solitary sports such as running and swimming which inadvertently promote rigidity (counting lengths/ laps) or sports that emphasise body shape (gymnastic/ dance/ ballet). It is better to encourage team sports which have a social component (hockey/ football/ netball). \r\nSuitable snacks for 30mins of moderate exercise are outlined in Table",
    " 13 which also accounts for the raised energy expenditure that occurs post-exercise. Furthermore, appropriate snacking can also help the young person to feel better in themselves by avoiding excessive post exercise exhaustion. Taking part in exercise will mean having more to eat. Eating snacks after exercise will not affect weight unless it is part of increasing muscle tone. After exercise the body will use the additional nutrition in the following ways (75): \r\n- Repair caused to muscle during e",

That is why the type, intensity and duration of exercise as well as energy intake are extremely important and caution needs to be taken (Table 14). Re-introducing exercise can encourage a person struggling with an eating disorder to continue their recovery, collaboratively. However, once exercise limits are set, they should be adhered to, so as to build confidence and trust between\r\n55 \r\nthe treatment tea",

    "iour versus AN behaviour \r\nAdolescence is a time when many physical and biological changes occur. Hormonal changes during puberty impact on/affect mood, behaviour, sleep patterns and the desire to take risks with decreased awareness of consequences and an increased stress level. Physical changes occur in the brain which impact on their emotions and their ability to understand others. There is a strong need for independence and wanting to separate from the family; friendships become a stronger in",
    "fluence as they try to establish themselves in society with an independent identity (76). \r\nAdolescence is therefore normally a time of transitions and of learning new coping strategies as your people struggle to cope with all the changes they are faced with. These years are often a time of experimentation with socialisation, partying, relationships, trying out different patterns of eating, fashion, looks, alcohol and drugs while making new friends and facing academic and other challenges (77). ",
    "\r\nWhen an adolescent is struggling with an eating disorder there is a risk that growth and development is delayed/ stunted due to lack of nutrition. AN often makes the young person socially isolated and peer relationships do not develop.  \r\nThe FT-AN approach places parents in control, which further limits the normal adolescent development. Parents’ can be encouraged to support age appropriate adolescent independence away from eating and meals if the young person continues to rely primarily on p",
    "arents regarding food choices. Be mindful that parents’ may feel socially isolated and lose sight of what normal adolescent development is and what the young person’s peers are doing. \r\nOnce eating issues/ weight concerns are no longer the primary concern, families need to be encouraged to deal with age appropriate decisions around negotiating adolescent issues which include education, socialising, exercising, flexible thinking and risk taking. The role for the team/ therapist/ dietitian is not ",
    "to make those decisions but to support the family to make age appropriate decisions by encouraging communication and modelling problem solving techniques. \r\nThe dietitian could be involved in thinking about meals out of the home, social events that involve food and alcohol, dealing with trips away from the family, cooking independently\r\n57 \r\nvegetarianism and planning for future issues. It is useful to help parents distinguish between adolescent and anorexic thinking around/ concerning food, eat",
    "ing patterns and alcohol. \r\nIn light of the low self-esteem which often accompanies AN it is essential to address the risks of alcohol and drug misuse; coping strategies and healthy general recommendations might need to be discussed with emphasis on risky behaviour associate with adolescents with AN. \r\nStrategies to do this \r\nThe forming of a these strategy needs to be family lead and, as these issues form part of the wider treatment package there is no definite advice, rather these issues need ",

    ". The range from the 50th to the 91st BMI centile is large (79) and many young people are very anxious to know how far into that range they will be required to go before they are allowed to switch to a plan that aims to maintain their weight. Post treatment weight trends are suggested to continue to be low for most patients diagnosed with AN in adolescents (although not in BN/BED), and clinicians should resist the pressure to initiate weight maintenance prematurely (80). \r\nWhen to initiate weigh",
    "t maintenance \r\nIn young people pre-morbid weight centile may be a good indicator of their individual trajectory. This can often be obtained from the NCMP data if there is no other record available. This information however should not be regarded in isolation and the following factors should also be assessed: \r\n- Is the young person able to eat in an unrestricted manner to appetite? - Is the young person able to eat a balanced healthy diet including all food groups in appropriate amounts to sust",
    "ain adolescent growth? \r\n- Is the young person able to consume energy dense foods and eat out socially with appropriate regularity? \r\n- Is there evidence of age appropriate pubertal development (menstruation)? - Does the young person continue to have any malnutrition related physical symptoms?\r\n58 \r\n- Is the young person able to undertake physical activity in line with current recommendations and maintain body weight? \r\nIf the answer to any of the questions above is ‘No’, the patient should be e",
    "ncouraged to shift the focus from weight to achieving the above behavioural goals. \r\nHealthy growth in adolescents \r\nIt is important for young people and their families to understand that adolescent growth, and therefore weight increase, does not discontinue until around age 20. In fact, from the ages of 13 to 18, weight and height increase rapidly, especially during the earlier years, provided nutritional provisions are adequate (Table 15) adapted from UK RCPCH (2012). \r\nTable 15: Healthy weigh",

    " yet from the growth charts it is clear, that this is to be expected and clinicians should resist the pressure to commit to a rigid EBW. In conjunction with this and in light of the above evidence, self-weighing should not be recommended for those recovering from AN and realistic expectations should be discussed with the patient and the family using the growth charts. \r\nCompetencies \r\n- Demonstrates understanding of normal adolescent growth rate \r\n- Be able to assess if weight maintenance phase ",

However, it is important to get the balance right. ",
    "\r\nEatwell Guide \r\nFor the general population The Eatwell Guide is a valuable tool to educate about the principles and importance of a balanced diet. The Eatwell Guide (2016) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide  \r\nHowever, concerns have been raised over the Eatwell Guide and its impact on psychoeducation for patients recovering from eating disorders (http://www.dietitiansmentalhealthgroup.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Statement-on the-use-of-the-Eatwell-Plate-in-Eatin",

However, this is not applicable to eating disorders patients as these foods need to be part of their di",

Counting calories is not recommended for young people with AN and not everyone should be on the same calorie intake for weight restoration. \r\nThe previous Eatwell Plate was used as a framework to explain dietary balance; however, the new version has its flaws in the field of eating disorders.

Once digested, they break down into glucose, which is the body’s basic fuel. Glucose is carried around the body by the blood and delivered to every cell in the body to provide energy. After a meal some glucose is used immediately as fuel but some is stored in the muscles and liver in the form of glycogen to be used later for fuel. \r\nThe human brain burns 500 to 600 ca",

If eating is restricted or delayed then symptoms of tiredness, low mood, poor concentration and a decrease in cognitive ability may result. Sleep disturbances are also often experienced. \r\nUK recommendations for carbohydrates intake is 50-55% of total dietary intake. Around a third of our plate at each meal should be made up of ",

    "cids: these are obtained through food as the human body cannot synthesise them. Omega 3 and omega 6 are the essential fatty acids our body requires. They play an important role in brain function, preventing heart disease, supporting many functions of the body and are a vital part of our body’s makeup. \r\n- Fatty acids provide a protective layer around essential organs and bones to protect from impacts and to insulate the body. \r\n- Saturated fats: are involved in the body’s immune system and in th",
    "e functioning of hormones. \r\nUK recommendations are that up to 35% of our total energy intake should be derived from fats. For example, on a 2000 calories diet, about 700 calories would be supplied by fat. Ideally, aim to eat more foods that contain the essential fatty acids such as nuts, seeds, olives, oily fish, sunflower oil and olive oil.\r\n61 \r\nEssential Fatty Acids \r\nOmega 3 Fatty acid is a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA).

The omega 3 fats are ALA (Alpha Linolenic Acid) DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenic acid). \r\n- ALA cannot be made in the body so must be eaten in the diet. It has important functions and is needed to make other omega 3 fats.

The most effective way to get enough DHA and EPA is to eat foods rich in these fats.

UK recommendations for protein intake are 10-15% of our total daily calorie intake. \r\nAmino acids form the building blocks of protein and the essential amino acids cannot be synthesised by the body therefore they need to be consumed from dietary sources. Good sources of protein include meat, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy products, pulses, nuts and quinoa. A variety of animal a",

Protein foods are also important sources of other nutrients such as iron, B vitamins, zinc, magnesium and omega 3 all of which are essential for physical health. \r\nAn adequate protein intake can also assist with psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Tryptophan, one of the essential amino acids, is a precursor of serotonin a neurotransmitter which is involved in mood regulation. Tryptophan is present in",

Often for young people with AN, rich sources of iron e.g. red meat are avoided due to fear of their high saturated fat content. Iron can be obtained from plant based sources (non-haem iron); however this is not as easily absorbed. For this reason young people following a vegetarian/vegan diet may need higher ir",

Dehydration can occur within 12hrs leading to tiredness, headaches and dizziness. The colour of urine is the best indicator of hydration. In the UK drinks provide 70-80% of our fluid requirements with the remaining 20-30% coming from food sources. The recommended amount o",
    "f fluid taken as drinks for children 9-13 yrs is 1.5L and for those over 14 yrs is 1.6L for females and 2.0L for males. This can come from water or in the form of juice, squash, milk or hot drinks which also provide valuable calories and nutrients when in recovery of AN. \r\nVegetarianism and veganism \r\nVegetarianism and veganism are becoming increasingly popular within the UK diet, especially amongst adolescent girls. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of 4- 18y old females found that ",
    "10% of girls aged 15-18yrs reported being either vegetarian or vegan (89). \r\nThe link between patients with an eating disorder and those who adopt a vegetarian diet is well established (90). It has been reported that up to 52% of parents presenting with AN are also vegetarian. The NHS estimates that ~2% of the UK population follow a vegetarian diet (NHS Choices, 2017).  \r\nThere are a number of types of vegetarian diets ranging from: \r\n- Semi-vegetarian where an individual will occasionally eat m",

    " working with patients with eating disorders have also noted a rise in the number of patients describing themselves as vegan although there is much less research into this area. Data from over 1000 patients identified that patients requiring in-patient treatment for their eating disorder presented with increased incidence of veganism, 11% in the case of adult in-patients and 16% of CAMH patients (Unpublished data – Fuller & Brown). The Vegan Society estimates that ~1% of the population of Great ",
    "Britain follow a vegan diet - this growing trend is driven by younger females, living in urban areas making more ethical and compassionate choices (The Vegan Society, 2016). \r\nEating a healthy balanced diet is important in maintaining physical health and reduces the risks of other illnesses or diseases later in life. A healthy balanced diet will therefore require an individual to eat a wide variety of foods, in the right proportions, to maintain an\r\n68 \r\nappropriate body weight where their body ",
    "can function – in females a key marker of this is menarche. Furthermore, in children and adolescents their diet should provide enough nutrition to ensure that they grow in height and develop through puberty. \r\nMany patients may have adopted a socially acceptable dietary exclusion as part of the development of their eating disorder. In line with a FT-AN approach the dietitian should assess the family belief around this. It is the dietitians’ role to educate the family about the incidence of vegan",
    "ism within the general population and among patients presenting with an eating disorder, so they can fully understand the relevance of a restriction in their child’s diet.  If the family do not believe the restriction is linked to the onset of the eating disorder the dietitian should support the family in re-feeding their child within the potential restrictions of a vegetarian or vegan diet. \r\nLegal considerations protecting veganism  \r\nHuman Rights Law \r\nThe European Convention on Human Rights ",
    "Article 9 states that there is a right to “Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion” specifically: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (European Convention of Human Rights, 1950) \r\nThe key point here is about the daily behaviours ",
    "that accompany a person’s belief, which for vegans means not consuming anything of animal origin, using animal products or products tested on animals. \r\nThe International Vegan Rights Alliance advises that any interference that limits a vegan’s practice may amount to coercion into a belief not of their choosing. The European Convention on Human Rights became part of UK law in 2000 as part of The Human Rights Act 1998.  \r\nVeganism and UK Equality Law: \r\nVeganism is a protected characteristic, cla",
    "ssified as a religion or belief under The Equality Act 2010 in England, Wales and Scotland. The Act outlaws direct and indirect discrimination, victimisation and harassment.  \r\nThe Vegan Society advises that in practice a vegan should be treated in the same way as you would treat a person with a specific religion, such as a Muslim, Christian or Jew. \r\nChildren and Young Adults: \r\nChildren and young adults are covered by the Equality Act 2010 and The Human Rights Act 1998 in the same way as adult",
    "s. \r\nAdditionally, the UN Convention on the Rights of The Child 1990 - which covers the rights of persons under 18 - underlines the right of children and young people to practice their religion or belief.

Whilst the majority of sip feeds on the market are suitable for patients following a vegetarian diet, there are no nutritionally complete vegan ACBS approved",
    " sip feeds or enteral feed. However, it is worth noting that the very definition of veganism recognises that the avoidance of animal use is as far as possible and practicable. A vegan may be willing to use a sip feed if there is no other alternative, in the same way that many vegans use medications that are tested on animals or contain animal products. \r\n70 \r\nIf a patient is at risk of refeeding syndrome, both in-patient and out-patient eating disorder teams may prescribe a multi-vitamin and or ",

Inpatient and outpatient eating disorder treatment programmes typically provide guidance on establishing a varied and adequate diet in order to promote healthy weight restoration, and in some circumstances nutrition educati",
    "on is provided (92), albeit topics of education can and do vary. It is common for a person’s physical, psychological and social wellbeing to be remarkably affected by an eating disorder and therefore creating and managing a life after these challenging illnesses can be difficult. In light of this, it is postulated that dietetic lead group education can help to enhance patient autonomy re: food choices and support in exploring and creating a life after an eating disorder (93). \r\nReduced costs and",
    " improved management of professional resources are some of the benefits group education offers. Group education also allows for peer support that would otherwise be unachievable for those participating in one-to-one dietetic counselling. Although the aforementioned are important benefits of group education, it must also be considered that for some individuals – shy or reluctant socialisers – the group environment is undoubtedly unsuitable (94). Additionally, it has also been documented that othe",
    "r worries related to anxiety associated with being in a group may cause some distress, for example concerns that “people will judge me” or comparative thinking towards other group members, e.g. thigh width or overall weight (93). \r\nThere is no blueprint to dietetic-led psycho-education groups, however when the aim is to enhance patient autonomy and support in exploring and creating a life after an eating disorder, useful topics to consider may include: creating a new and more permissive and flex",
    "ible manner regarding food and eating situations; enjoying a social life that includes and embraces food; development of skills, knowledge and confidence to shop for oneself, or even to help parents with shopping in a healthy and non-eating disorder manner; planning, preparing and even cooking healthy meals. A general guidance on the format of group education programmes can be seen below, with this level of intensity likely reflecting\r\n71 \r\nrealistic implementation resource availability within t",
    "he NHS (93). As with any dietetic intervention, key behaviour change strategies should underpin the programmes’ content. \r\nExample format of a group education programme: \r\n- Participants attend 3 x 90min weekly or fortnightly education sessions - Facilitated by dietitians in the service \r\n- Themed topics – topical - press/ news related; myths around nutrition; bone health; importance of essential fats \r\n- Run approx. 4-5 per year, however this will depend on demand \r\n- Participants are encourage",

    "ation and should be considered and monitored for in such patients (95, 96). As starvation and malnutrition can occur for a large number of reasons in childhood and adolescence, it should be considered in all children irrespective of underlying condition or specialty. \r\nThe refeeding syndrome is a physiological phenomenon driven by insulin resulting in deranged biochemistry which leads to cardiovascular abnormalities. During starvation, insulin concentrations decrease and glucagon levels rise in ",
    "response to depleted glucose. Glucagon breaks down glycogen forming glucose, rapidly depleting muscle and liver glycogen stores (97). As glycogen stores are depleted, gluconeogenesis is activated utilising lipids and proteins as metabolic substrates to form glucose. However, gluconeogenesis has a limited capacity to support the body’s energy requirements. Therefore, during this period of low serum insulin, hormone sensitive lipase is activated and breaks down adipose tissue to form fatty acids a",
    "nd glycerol; the fatty acids are transported to the liver to be converted to ketones. Ketones now replace glucose as the body’s major energy source during acute starvation (98, 99). \r\nComplications manifest with the introduction of carbohydrates, triggering a metabolic sequence of events due to a switch from ketone to glucose metabolism. The subsequent insulin surge that occurs in response to rising serum glucose levels causes a rapid intracellular movement of glucose, fluid and electrolytes (10",
    "0, 101). \r\nFor most young people, the most significant finding will be a fall in serum phosphate. When undernourished patients are fed, there is an increased requirement for phosphate as the body switches back to carbohydrate metabolism, which can be potentiated by a background of relative phosphate depletion in starvation. Phosphate levels in the blood begin to fall, and cardiovascular and neurological sequelae may follow (26) \r\nThe most important factor is anticipating and remaining vigilant f",
    "or biochemical and clinical features of the refeeding syndrome, especially in the first 48 hours, and then the first five days of initiating feeding. Low phosphate levels will usually correct when treated with oral phosphate supplements, or given intravenously if the enteral supplement is not tolerated. \r\nRefeeding syndrome may occur up to two weeks after initiating feeding, so vigilance is needed for this period.

When coupled with restricted nutritional intake, this lends itself to a rapid deterioration in health.

Most oral nutritional supplements and enteral feeds contain 42-46% energy from carbohydrates, regardless of whether they are standard or high energy formulas.
