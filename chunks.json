Executive Summary 
The aim of this clinical guideline is to provide a practical approach to the dietetic complexities of young people with anorexia nervosa – other eating disorders are alluded to throughout the guideline but not in depth. The working group was formed by systematically recruiting specialist dietitians during the national training which was funding by NHS England. Interventions range from complex energy calculations throughout the refeeding process, to thoughtful thinking around engagement and challenging feared food; utilising and emphasising the unique skills of the specialist eating disorders dietitian. 
Family based treatment (FT-AN) is the evidence based treatment model for young people with AN and therefore dietitians should be focusing their treatment programmes to align with FT-AN. Dietitians working in eating disorders must have an understanding of the underlying dynamics and be aware of their professional boundaries when treating these complex patients. It is important to highlight the importance of a synergy between psychological and nutrition; without psychological understanding and support, nutritional rehabilitation is likely to be ineffective. Conversely, malnutrition will impact cognitive function and behaviour. 
The authors are drawn from practicing paediatric and adolescent specialist eating disorders dietitians from around England, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Additional advice was sought from family therapists and psychiatrists. Each author focused on their specialist area of interest within eating disorders. The importance of evidence based practice in a field with limited research has demanded a thorough review of available evidence and has also drawn upon clinical experience and practice. 
Throughout the guidelines recommended competencies have been highlighted to emphasise key points within sections ensuring the dietitian can focus their understanding and learning. Although these guidelines focus on the dietitians role in treating and managing AN the dietitian must align with the multidisciplinary team and should not be treating young people with AN as sole practitioners.

Introduction 
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe chronic mental health disorder associated with negative outcomes and with the highest mortality of all psychiatric disorders (1). AN is defined as maintaining a weight below a healthy range by restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, gender, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Additionally, AN is commonly linked with other comorbid psychological conditions including: depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; obsessive-compulsive disorder; and personality disorders (2). 
The peak onset for AN diagnosis in females in the United Kingdom is between 15 and 19 years with an incidence rate of 0.2% of the population (3). The timing of the peak onset during adolescents is problematic in that it is also a time when energy requirements essential for pubertal growth spurt are at their peak. The combination of high energy requirements, nutritional restriction and excessive exercising lends itself to a rapid deterioration in health, particularly during vulnerable periods of brain development and physical growth, resulting in potentially permanent physical and psychological consequences (4). 
Nutritional intervention is an important component in the treatment of eating disorders and the dietitian is therefore an essential member of the multidisciplinary team, especially in the presence of other co-morbidities such as coeliac disease, food allergies and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Dietitians should not treat eating disorders as sole practitioners and must work within a multidisciplinary team (5). 
Screening and diagnosis 
Paediatricians and general practitioners often refer young people with a history of weight loss to the dietitian. It is therefore not unusual for dietitians to be the first health care professionals to identify or question a possible eating disorder. 
Medical 
Although medical investigations may be necessary to rule out organic aetiology responsible for weight loss or food avoidance, eating disorders are much more common than most differential diagnoses for weight loss: hyperthyroidism, Type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease or neoplastic disease (tumour). Amenorrhoea may result from ovarian or pituitary disease, or following use of the contraceptive pill. Clinical assessment should focus on determining the severity of malnutrition as well as possible causes, and should include hydration status, temperature, muscle wasting and cardiovascular status, with particular attention to heart rate and orthostatic blood pressure. The sit up, squat, stand test is a useful clinical sign to monitor the clinical status of malnourished patients (5). 
Clinical features 
AN is a psychiatric disorder that predominately affects females. It varies in severity, with extreme nutritional restriction accompanied by other associated behaviours such as binge eating, self-induced vomiting, purging, over-exercising and self-harm (6). The cognitive distortion associated with AN results in dieting behaviour and an intense fear of weight gain
7 
and fatness. Generally there is no loss of appetite, but satisfaction in feeling ‘empty’ and hunger overrides the need to eat, and weight loss is viewed as an achievement; thus sufferers have limited desire to change (7). 
Identifying an eating disorder in the early stages is difficult due to the deceptive nature of the disease, especially when presentation is atypical - a lack of awareness that AN can occur in children and boys historically led to a delay in referral, diagnosis and treatment (8) . Clinical signs of AN include: 
Weight loss 
In AN body weight is maintained at least 15% below that expected. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of underweight is a percentage body mass index (%mBMI) below 85% (where %mBMI is BMI/median BMI for age and gender). For the majority of the population a healthy %mBMI will fall between 95-105% (9, 10). A consequence of low weight is that pubertal development is halted, resulting in either a delay in reaching menarche or secondary amenorrhoea, which can have implications on bone health. Physical signs of poor nutrition and low weight include: sunken cheeks, temporal lobes and eyes; dull thinning hair; lanugo hair; cold extremities and feeling cold; and delayed puberty (11). 
Avoidance of food 
Avoidance of food occurs gradually over time, with subtle restriction of nutritional intake including eliminating snacks, reducing portion sizes, hiding food and missing meals. Furthermore, avoidance of food can transfer into the social setting: the young person will avoid eating out due to a lack of control over food preparation, or because it may interrupt rigid exercise routines or other ‘rules’. Conversely, the young person can be overly involved with food shopping, meal preparation and baking but will avoid eating themselves. Young people with eating disorders will often have an extensive knowledge about the calorie content of food but this is often the limit of their understanding about food and nutrition. It is a common misconception that young people with AN have a good comprehension of nutrition; in fact they are often unable to understand information or interpret it correctly, hence the importance of nutrition education (12). 
Morbid preoccupation with weight and/or shape 
Energy dense foods are avoided because of a fear of gaining weight or a change in body shape that may accompany eating. Girls perceive their stomach and thighs as particularly fat, whereas boys may be more concerned about musculature and are more likely to exercise excessively. 
Poor self-esteem 
Feelings of ineffectiveness are extremely common and often married with depressive and anxiety features, impaired concentration, critical inner-voice and obsessional symptoms. Social interests decline as young people with eating disorders lose weight and most become socially withdrawn. Many of these features reverse with weight gain (11). Perfectionism is a trait that can converge with poor self-esteem, resulting in extreme competiveness, asceticism and the need to please; subsequently young people with AN tend to be high achievers and can be perceived by peers and family as coping with life demands.
8 
Compensatory Behavioural features 
These comprise of behaviours that are executed to ‘un-do’ or compensate for the effects of just having eaten. Their purpose is to relieve a feeling of guilt from eating or consuming more calories than intended, to relieve anxiety associated with eating and / or to provide an emotional relief from eating. They are also an attempt to promote weight loss, suppress appetite, induce vomiting or minimise the absorption of food. Several different drugs can be misused including: diet pills, diuretics, laxatives and the drug ipecac to help induce vomiting. The misuse of drugs is more often seen in bulimic patients. 
Purging 
Purging involves all forms of self-induced compensation for unwanted consumption of calories plus methods to lower weight by loss of bodily fluids These can include self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretic abuse, or ingestion of thyroid hormone or stimulant-type medication.  
Self-induced vomiting 
Self-induced vomiting can be executed manually or by using an object. Russel’s Sign is an indication of self-induced vomiting, presenting as scraped or raw areas of skin on a patient’s knuckles. However, the absence of this sign is not an indication that purging is not occurring as patients may use alternative objects, such as a tooth brush, to help induce vomiting.  
Another common sign of vomiting is the erosion of tooth enamel, which is particularly marked on the lingual surface of the upper teeth. Other dental changes include increased sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures or a possible increase in dental caries (13). A second clinical sign is bilateral, painless swelling of the salivary glands particularly the parotid glands on the sides of the face (14). Excessive consumption of fluids is common to help facilitate vomiting or as a way of manipulating body weight. 
Misuse of laxatives 
A laxative is a medicine that is used to treat constipation by helping the body to stimulate emptying of the bowel. While more common within the bulimic population, laxative misuse is also found across other eating disorders sub-types including anorexia nervosa, and is used as a way of controlling weight, shape or body composition (15). It involves consuming an amount of the drug many times in excess of the manufacturer’s recommendation. Laxatives do not help to aid weight loss in the long term, in the short term weight loss may be temporary as large amounts of water and minerals are being removed. 
Diuretics 
The use of diuretics or water pills is another form of purging – they help to increase the frequency of urination and remove water from the body. There are complications associated with taking diuretics, including: thirst, muscle cramps or weakness, confusion, fainting, risk of seizures, nausea, vomiting, increased uric acid levels, hypothermia, cardiac complications (irregular heartbeats, arrhythmia, palpitations), muscle paralysis, kidney damage, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities (hypo sodium and potassium). Diuretics can also cause fluid shifts, retention and oedema.
9 
Over-exercising 
This counts as a form of purging when it is done as a compensatory behaviour to control weight rather than for pleasure. Indication that over-exercising may be occurring include:  
- Continued exercise while injured 
- Exercising when unwell 
- Exercising in bad weather e.g. rain and snow 
- The need to increase duration to attain the same benefit 
- Refusing to sit down/ inappropriate standing 
- Continually walking around the house 
- Walking/running up and down the stairs 
- Frantic pacing back and forth across a room 
- Exercising at unusual hours or in private e.g. secretly in their bedroom 
Weight Manipulation 
Young people with AN may try to manipulate their weight by making it appear higher than it actually is and to demonstrate that they are complying with treatment for example: by drinking excessive amounts of fluid, hiding coins, stones, sand, foreign objects in pockets, shoes or underwear, inserting foreign objects inside their body. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid or ‘water loading’ can lead to electrolyte disturbances. Young people should always be weighed at a similar time of the day, in minimal or similar clothing to previous weight measurements, with no shoes, an empty bladder and making sure all pockets are empty. If weight manipulation is suspected, random, unscheduled weight checks may be of benefit. However, these should not be done on a regular basis or else the young person will suspect that this will be done again and continue to manipulate their weight. 
Appetite Suppressants 
Young people with AN may use a variety of substances to help reduce their appetite and feelings of hunger. Often these are products that can be purchased over the counter e.g. stimulants, caffeinated drinks, energy drinks such as Red Bull, or over-the-counter diet pills or nicotine. Excessive use of chewing gum can also cause bloating, stomach ache and have a laxative effect. 
Insulin Misuse in Diabetes 
Diabulimia is the misuse of insulin either by deliberate avoidance or by manipulation of their prescribed dose of insulin as a way of controlling body weight and or shape in patients with insulin dependent diabetes (16).

10 
Management – Focused Family Based Treatment (FT-AN) Although inpatient and day patient treatments are generally effective in weight restoration of patients with AN, they are also disruptive to family, social and educational life. Therefore, intensive outpatient treatment should be sought if possible. FT-AN can be summarised as an intensive outpatient treatment where parents play an active and positive role. Parents are seen as a resource in treatment, developing methods to restore their malnourished adolescent’s weight. The expectation is that parents take a lead in managing their child’s eating in the early stages of treatment. In most cases, the treatment comprises three phases consisting of 15-20 treatment sessions over 6-12months. 
With the therapist families are encouraged to explore how the eating disorder and the interactional patterns in the family have become entangled and how this entanglement has made it difficult for the family to get back on track with their normal developmental course. 
When deciding whether day patient or inpatient care is most appropriate a number of factors need to be considered including: the young person’s weight; the rate of weight loss; the medical status; and crucially whether the parents/ carers can support them and keep them from significant harm as an outpatient. Furthermore, in some cases outpatient treatment is just not an option due to the presence of overt systemic issues or strong/ risky AN cognitions and behaviors. 
Phase 1: Dietetic engagement, development of therapeutic alliance and restoration of the young person’s weight 
Client and family focused approach 
As outlined in the NICE guidelines for eating disorders(17), in the first phase the aim is “to establish a good therapeutic alliance with the person, their parents or carers and other family members”. Change cannot happen outside a therapeutic relationship (18). 
Universally, dietetic practice has shifted over time to a client-focused approach. This is an improvement over the traditional medical approach, in which the dietitian is regarded as the expert (in charge of treatment and knowing all). Family focused eating disorder treatment is a two-way process i.e. looking at how clinicians can be both client and family focused (taking into account aspects of both). 
We should always be aiming to include the young person’s voice and trying to find the right fit with them; in the correct environment a child-centered approach can enhance their motivation to change. However, the dietitian cannot be completely child-focused, because that could inadvertently mean engaging with decisions influenced by the eating disorder.  
Therefore, the extent that the young person will be part of the decision making in their treatment will depend on the severity of their illness.  
Early in treatment clinicians should “support the parents or carers to take a central role in helping the young person manage their eating and emphasise that this is a temporary role” (17). The dietitian would be using a family focused approach, looking at how they can empower the parents / caregivers to manage the eating disorder, rather than doing the work on behalf of the parents. This opens up more possibilities in relation to the support of the young person. Whilst adhering to a client-focused approach, it is important to consider the young person’s individual needs and developmental stage. 
11 
Ideally, the young person will participate in developing a plan and therefor agree to follow the plan. If they don’t agree because their anorexic cognitions are too strong, the plan should be phrased in a language that fits them: for example, referencing food as medicine; that their parents know what they need and that this is a way of returning to previous interests – such as sports/ drama classes. 
Factors that may affect a young person’s readiness to engage include their level of motivation to change, cognitive flexibility, and developmental expectations and limitations (19).  Nutritional psychoeducation with the young person often aids in enhancing motivation in the young person e.g. discussing bone health and risk of fractures; exercise and sport goals; brain shrinkage and the desire to do well in school; fertility and future desires. 
Furthermore, the dietitian should be looking at enhancing the young person’s relationship with the parents because a robust relationship will be helpful to recovery. So, treatment should have a positive impact on their relationship and encourage the young person to feel that their parents are there for them and fighting the eating disorder as a united team; i.e. developing a shared narrative of parental care needed to overcome the eating disorder. 
It is important to consider the young person’s capacity to make decisions. There are many analogies to help parents understand that the eating disorder has left their child incompetent to have the age-appropriate food control and that they need to take responsibility. Figure 1 depicts the analogy of the solar eclipse. Here you would ask parents which of these three scenarios resonates with them. It is not unusual for parents not to have the same perspective as each other or with the young person, so the analogy may lead usefully to some conversation about this.

If the young person has capacity to use treatment then you would discuss the eclipse analogy in front of the parents. If the dietitian perceives the session as being dominated by the eating disorder cognitions then he or she may focus on the parents – for example, by asking: Is this your child talking, or the illness. It is important to engage each family member in sessions and make strong efforts to develop rapport or an alliance with each family member (20).  
12 
An Aligned Approach 
The dietitian’s primary focus early in treatment is to assist parents / caregivers in managing challenges to the renourishment process. Key principles dietitians should focus on whilst implementing an FT-AN aligned approach are outlined in table 1 (19) 
The focus of this empowerment is not only on enhancing their confidence to act but helping parents to solve the problem of weight restoration. Whilst providing nutritional expertise, dietitians should keep in mind how they can implement an FT-AN aligned approach; the treatment philosophy is critical to providing coherent interdisciplinary care with particular focus on: 
- Increasing caregiver alignment 
- Increasing parental / caregiver renourishment confidence 
- Externalising the illness from the young person 
- Maintaining an agnostic stance 
(20)
13 
Table 1: Key principles for dietitians to focus on whilst implementing an FT-AN aligned approach (19) 
Increasing parental / caregiver alignment 
Align parental food beliefs and feeding practices 
• Assist parents in identifying their own preferences. 
• Clarify tightly held food beliefs and values. 
• Reframe healthy eating behaviours in the context of a serious illness. 
• Resolve conflictual views that divide family members and the recovering young person. 
Increasing parental / caregiver renourishment confidence 
• Identify clear steps for renourishment 
• Support parental empowerment and build confidence through competence. Reinforce positive steps parents have taken in the renourishment process. 
• Identify and label distractions from the task at hand: negotiation, preferences, threats, compromises. 
Externalisation of illness 
• Help parents identify irrational nutrition beliefs aligned with the eating disorder. • Query chronology of food ‘preferences’ and model language for caregivers that separates pro-eating disorder and eating disorder food preferences versus pro-recovery behaviours and client food preferences. 
Maintaining an agnostic stance 
• Highlight challenges associated with identifying a specific cause, dispelling common myths, and emphasizing data supporting prioritisation of symptom disruption over insight on cause (e.g. Lock et al. 2010). Redirect conversations toward solution-focused discussion. 
• Tone of communication with parents should remain non-blaming and non-pejorative in keeping with the belief that parents are not to blame for their child’s illness. 
Maintaining a non-authoritarian stance 
• Support rather than prescribing parents’ renourishment efforts. For example, rather than saying 'You should be ensuring that she is having butter on her toast', making more of an observation 'It sounds like the eating disorder is getting activated when you butter the toast'.
14 
The following information from the initial sessions is helpful when evaluating the extent of parental empowerment and potential impediments (20): 
- What language do the parents / caregivers use at the outset? How confident do the parents / caregivers appear and does their confidence match steps they have taken to address their young person’s dilemma? 
- How quickly did the family respond once the problem had been identified? - What sorts of barriers were there to acting on the problem of the eating disorder (lack of communication, closeness – e.g., “We don’t really eat meals together”)? - How do parents respond to the directive to take responsibility for refeeding? Do they appear reluctant, resigned, actively against or eager to enact this role? - What type of planning behaviour do the parents demonstrate at the end of the session? 
Dietitians should be aware of the early signs which indicate lack of parental empowerment. These include: 
- Parents defer to the young person on decisions related to eating. 
- Parents overtly state that they are unable to take over all meals. 
- Parents frequently reference alternative forms of treatment. 
- Parents ‘demand’ that the clinician provide concrete solutions. While solutions are performed in collaboration with the clinician, some parents / caregivers may become frustrated by the reality that there is no one right way to refeed their child. 
- How often are the parents reaching out to the clinician or other members of the treatment team in between sessions? 
- What kinds of questions are they identifying/asking? 
- Do their questions and concerns reflect an underlying anxiety about their capabilities, confusion about the illness, how to respond or a lack of confidence in the treatment team or model? 
- 
Strategies to formulate some of the above dilemmas have been outlined in table 2, which focuses on key skills for dietitians to consider whilst implementing a FT- AN aligned approach.
15 
Table 2: Key skills for dietitians whilst implementing a FT-AN aligned approach (20)
Key Skills for dietitians 
Examples
Tolerating or managing emotions in the session: 
Provide empathy or content for the challenges of renourishment rather than attempting to alleviate distress.
Reminding parents that the challenges they face in healing their child to eat more are excellent examples of why they need to step in, as their child would not be able to manage these difficulties alone 
Use of validating responses: When we validate someone else’s experience by listening well, respecting their feelings, and accepting their experience we can support them in the moment and build a stronger relationship. 
Dialectical responses: avoids assumptions and blaming, making the conversation more flexible, and can dissolve the dichotomous thing that creates standoffs. In formulating a dialectical response, you look at all sides of a situation, avoid extreme words that challenge the young person’s point of view, and avoid the use of ‘but’, which tends to negate whatever was said before. Instead, use the word ‘and’ to bring the conflicting thoughts or points together, like the two sides of one coin
Pre-empt family concerns. 
When sharing the weight - state that the type of weight gain is healthy and expected and on target for outpatient treatment
Self-reflexivity: 
At times their own emotional reaction to a family may be an obstacle.
Clinicians may experience anxiety around their ability to engage families which may contribute to their feeling of helplessness; or may harbor their own feelings of criticism and blame toward parental behaviour
Manage family criticism: 
By directly shaping critical comments and behaviour; reframing, restarting or redirecting these statements.
Selective ignoring in relation to no engaging/ responding to behaviours that distract from the task. 
Helping parents manage their frustration – focus on externalisation and separation of AN from the child.



16 
Owning expertise 
Concordant evidence-based treatment is about creating a culture of collaboration; the merging of clinicians’ clinical eating disorder expertise with parental expertise (17). Tables 3 and 4 expand of the unique skills dietitians’ possess which enhance expertise. 
- We are experts on eating disorders and how to best treat these illnesses – families likely have little or no prior experiences with eating disorders. Thus, our role is to support the parents / caregivers in their efforts to reverse starvation. At the same time we need to balance this role with an awareness of parental expertise in unrivalled knowledge of their child – they have watched their child grow and evolve into what they are today and have a rich narrative to share. 
- Thus, dietitians need to learn “the nuances of the dance between actively attuning to family perspectives and strengths, reinforcing healthy decision making, and setting clear expectations on treatment tasks and goals” 
(20) 
The use of dietitians within or alongside FT-AN would help to enhance parental / care giver confidence, enhance the FT-AN tenets, whilst also providing nutritional expertise. In fact, these benefits offer evidence-based nutrition guidance for the treatment team as well as the family.
17 
Table 3: Outlines an overview of the dietitians’ unique skills and promoting ‘owning expertise’ over the phases of FT-AN. 
•Determine the appropriate level and form of nutrition 
support 
•Able to understand the complex relationship between 
food intake and overall physiological health. 
•Provide knowledge with regards to how much to eat, 
what to eat, when to eat, and how to navigate complex 
food systems or circumstances to help correct negative 
energy balance. 
•Assist with cognitive restructuring of faulty or 
maladaptive food beliefs. 
•Translate and individualise evidence-based nutrition 
recommendations. 
•Provide assistance with meal planning and meal 

Support  all phases  of  
treatment 
supervision. 
•Discuss behavioural strategies. 
•Support unique subpopulations, such as those with diet-restricting comorbidities (eg, diabetes, coeliac disease, gastrointestinal disorders, food allergies); cultural norms (eg, Kosher, halal, vegetarian); or psychosocial factors (eg, food insecurity). Subpopulations may also include those with increased energy needs, such as athletes or adolescents that require catch-up growth. 
•Guide families around the safe level of physical activity (frequency, duration and intensity), based on young person’s medical readiness (weight for height, vitals) with an understanding of a young person’s emotional experience around physical activity. As well as recommend an eating plan changes to allow for this. 
Assist the team in reconciling the family or patient’s self-report of nutritional intake and challenges/barriers in contrast to objective data, such as weight and vital sign progress. 
•Allow team members to more frequently reinforce basic eating disorder facts and align with consistent nutrition and eating disorder messaging.

Phase  1 / 2 
• Help to facilitate greater energy density and food variety, sooner rather than later which are associated with best prognosis. 
• Help to determine weight, height, and %mBMI goals based on a young person’s history, bloods, vitals, temperature, hormones. Subsequently, they can also provide a projected rate of weight gain to restore historical growth channels. 
• Estimate the young person’s nutritional needs, specifically their calorie, protein, and fluid goals. Given the extraordinary circumstances and risks of eating disorders, such as hypermetabolism, abnormal laboratory values, refeeding syndrome risk, and malnutrition status, dietitians are well positioned to adjust nutritional and projected rate of weight gain goals to address these. 
• Provide education about eating disorders: what they are, how new research informs us (eg, gut microbiome, genetics, neurobiology), and how this new science informs treatment. 
• Investigate the food/mealtime environment, and evaluate parental feeding practices, knowledge and confidence.

Phase 3 Phase 4 
Initial consultations 
•Provide advice on normal eating and reframe healthy eating behaviours in the context of a serious illness. 
•Support the young person to transition away from the stricter meal planning and help them make food choices that are healthful and less restrictive. 
•Guide the family back to previously secure and appropriate developmental eating behaviours.

•Serve as a guide for helping the family navigate changing needs for energy balance over the lifespan.

As previously shown, FT-AN aims to empower families to address and reverse the factors maintaining AN. Using the FT-AN approach as part of the dietetic assessment slightly alters the structure in which assessments take place and their focus; however, a thorough assessment remains important. Table 3 outlines an overview of the dietitians’ unique skills in promoting ‘owning expertise’ in the treatment of AN.  
The aim remains to facilitate: 
- Increased calorie intake 
- Reduce food rigidity 
- Increase food variety 
20 
sooner rather than later, as this is associated with the best prognosis (21). Parents are seen as critical resources in helping their child overcome the illness, therefore they require education about an eating disorder to understand their child’s nutritional and psychological need. 
The assessment should usually take place when first meeting the young person. It sets out the ongoing therapeutic relationship and the role of the dietitian. There is a clear assessment against norms and the resulting problems as a result of dietary restriction are identified and explained to the young person and their carers/families. Often the effects of under eating are not associated with common symptoms and the families or care givers may be still looking for an alternative medical explanation for these symptoms. 
When meeting with the whole family the key topics for discussion are the FT-AN approach with focus on the current symptoms with primary aim of weight restoration and disruption of eating disorder behaviours: 
- The consultation should be constructive and not seem like an interrogation. 
- An acknowledgement from the start that it is important to be honest will improve outcome and produce the best possible picture of their family’s current predicament. 
- The child should be seen as separate from the illness and not to blame for the eating disorder. 
- A history of concern and any relevant information pertaining to the young patient and family should be gathered but it is not helpful to focus on causes and aetiology and this should be avoided. 
- Exploring the impact of the illness on the family and ways in which it may have had disabling effects on them could prove useful and helps focus on the problem itself rather than the child. 
- If there is a family history of eating disorders understanding this may help the patient’s family to supervise the young person and to indicate what education and support they need. 
- Underlying diagnoses of autism, Asperger’s and OCD may help adapt the approach along with other conditions which may be relevant to treatment or have caused the distress leading to the eating disorder such as coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and food allergies. 
Focusing on the young person’s views/concerns the initial dietetic assessment with the family should cover the following areas: 
- Why are you here today? 
- What do you think about their weight? 
- What do they think about gaining weight? 
- Do they have a target weight in mind and if so where did they derive this from? 
- Do they think they can follow a plan, even if they don’t want to gain weight, but they will to avoid admission? 
- Do they think they need to eat more or less than others?
21 
- What do they think about their mood, concentration, energy levels and friendships? 
The Parent’s or carer’s views/concerns: 
- Why are you here today? 
- What are your current worries? 
- What do you think about your child’s current weight? 
- Over what period have you noticed changes to weight, diet and exercise? 
- What have these changes been? 
Home life 
- Who lives at home? Parents, siblings, grandparents, step family, parents/siblings partners. 
- Who provides the childcare on a daily basis? 
- Who does the cooking? 
- How do meal times usually work / who sits down at what time? 
- If parents are working, where does the young person go after school? 
- Where are meals usually eaten if not at home, under parental supervision? 
- Who does the food shopping? 
- How does this routine differ at weekends? 
- Is there a family pet, such as a dog, which can consume dropped food at meal times? 
- Does the young person eat out with friends, or have they become more socially isolated? 
- How are they getting on at school/education? 
Exercise levels 
Ascertain if the parent’s opinions on their child’s exercise levels are the same as the young person or if there is any suspicion of hidden exercise of the kind that can be done in the bedroom – e.g. sit ups, squats, planks etc. Other examples would include; exercise bursts such as running on the spot or pacing round the house, many unnecessary journeys, and resistance to sitting down for longer periods or need to go for long walks or runs, with anxiety sometimes being a factor where this is not possible. 
- What physical activity does the young person do? 
- Are they members of sports clubs or have a gym membership?
22 
- Do they run or cycle? 
- Are they monitoring the steps they take each day, for example on a Fitbit/ other app? 
- What is the frequency of this exercise and are they distressed if they cannot complete it? 
These questions give a better understanding of the young person’s predicament and will help to form a meal plan that is acceptable and manageable to the young person. They will also give a better understanding of how the reduction of food intake initially took place and over what time period, together with the young person’s beliefs or understanding of food, calories, fat, carbohydrate and what is healthy and or unhealthy – views which do not always fit with the generally accepted or scientifically proven viewpoints. They may also focus the family on the key problems. 
Other relevant questions to consider during the initial consultations are outlined below. Be mindful that a parent’s opinion may differ to that of the young person 
- Binge eating – clarify what their definition of a binge is and the frequency and length of time they have been participating in this. 
- Vomiting – do they make themselves vomit? If so, ask about frequency, amounts vomited and triggers around/for this, and how long this has been happening for. If they are not vomiting, have they ever tried? 
- Laxative use – prescribed or over the counter, amounts, type used, how long for. 
- Smoking/ caffeine consumption – known appetite suppressants 
- Other medication – slimming pills, appetite suppressants, vitamins (consider rationale for use and appropriate dosing to avoid toxicity and explain that taking these does not mean the diet doesn’t matter), other prescribed medication. 
- Other medical diagnosis 
Menstruation 
Regular periods are a good indicator of clinical wellness and the return of menstruation usually coincides with significant weight restoration. In some cases it may take a number of months for menstruation to start once weight restored; related to physiological levels of oestrogen. (22). It can be difficult and intrusive to verify menstruation, nonetheless it is essential to establish if the young person is having regular periods, and if not, when was their last one. 
Hypometabolic state 
Does the young person have any complaints of fatigue, always cold, tiredness, poor concentration and dizziness? How often do these symptoms occur – they may need a medical review. This information can then be used to link back to medical explanations and why change in dietary intake to boost metabolic rate is important.
23 
Gastro symptoms 
Ascertain bowel function/ movement is normal and what is normal for the young person. Any complaints of oesophageal reflux, abdominal bloating, constipation and pain associated with eating are likely due to changes as a result of poor intake and slowed peristalsis/gastric emptying and should resolve on build-up of food and refeeding but identifying when these started in relation to food restriction is useful. 
If problems continue post weight restoration then a medical review maybe indicated. This would also be important if symptoms of pain, bloating, mucus or blood in stools are discovered to predate eating issues and would be suggestive of an urgent medical review to rule out IBD or coeliac disease. 
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare complication, which is caused by the compression of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery, which has lost its surrounding adipose tissue and causes upper abdominal pain after eating, nausea and vomiting. It is usually caused by very rapid and extreme weight loss scenarios (23). 
Swallowing/Choking 
It is important to ask about any problems with regard to swallowing food. Does their diet history suggest they are picking certain types of foods – texture wise? Consider vomit or choking phobia or medical problem such as eosinophilic oesophagitis.  
Technology 
Does the young person use multiple apps to record food intake, check calories or calculate how much energy they have burned by doing different amounts of exercise? Has the young person become more hands on with food preparation and planning; researching recipes and looking in detail at food labels? Do the parents feel they could or need to remove these apps from the young person’s phone? 
Since going through the assessment do the young person and/or their parents recognise changes in their life as a result of weight loss and dietary restriction? How has this impacted on them socially, individually and as a family, has this increased arguments at home? If so what do they think about this? 
We need to consider that as our patients are young adults they rely heavily on social media and computers as a way of communication. A recent study showed that 70% of participants rated web-based electronic applications as easier to use and more fun compared to paper based food diaries (24).  
The usefulness of this type of technology to collect nutrient intake data was validated in a larger study in 2014 with a total of 100 participants. The aim of the study was to assess the reproducibility and validity of an online programme compared to a 4-day weighed food record. The results demonstrated that online tools are effective for assessing nutrient and food group intake in healthy adults (25). However, these results need to be cautiously interpreted as these patients were either obese or within a healthy range and it is likely that patients with eating disorders may have a different response to this type of dietary collection. 
Education around starvation  
- Explain the meaning and risks associated with refeeding syndrome, so that parents and young person are not scared of the process and
24 
understand the importance and what to expect. It’s not unusual for the young person to over eat during the early treatment period - in hope of being discharged from eating disorders services. 
- Regularly refer to the long-term and short-term effects of starvation and relate back to symptoms exhibited/reported by young people, as part of an education process of understanding the problems with the condition. 
- Calculate the young person’s energy requirements versus current intake, same for protein, iron, calcium etc. In order to demonstrate where diet deficiencies are. 
- Discuss normal/ expected growth versus where they are currently – education about % weight loss and safe % BMI. Use of growth charts to illustrate this can be helpful. 
- Reiterate negative medical effects and risks with continuing current restrictive eating. 
Strategies to help 
- Avoid using phone apps during the early stages of treatment 
- Discuss reintroduction of exercise as part of a motivational tool e.g. PE at school/Walking to school. 
- Organise supervision and support at meal times, including at school. 
- Basic meal planning – include education to care givers on appropriate portion sizes and composition of meals and snacks and their frequency, but make it relevant to normal family food patterns and routines.

The Nutritional Assessment 
A formal assessment of nutritional status is good practice when commencing outpatient treatment for an eating disorder. 
The dietetic aims of nutritional assessment are to: 
- Examine current nutritional status and identify any deficits. 
- Assess existing and potential risks of maintaining a low weight including the effect on growth and development that can occur over time and explain these to the family. 
- Gain information about the eating behaviour, beliefs and attitudes of the young person and their parents’/ carer. 
- Assess the overall risk of refeeding syndrome. 
- Feed this information back to the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to establish treatment goals and objectives. 
Anthropometric 
The use of weight alone has limited use in young people owing to the normal changes in weight, height and body mass index (BMI) in childhood and throughout puberty. Weight and BMI can be used to track changes in an individual but any comparison of weight against population norms needs to take account of height, sex and age. It is perfectly correct to use BMI centile charts and to report BMI centile in young people. However, for patients below the 0.4th BMI centile, there is a need to quantify the degree of underweight. Using %BMI (BMI/median BMI for age and gender) instantly provides information about a patient’s nutritional status without the need to refer to a chart. Furthermore, young people and parents understand the concept of %BMI. 
Weight and Height 
Weight and height should be measured in kilograms and meters, respectively. Ensure weights are measured in minimal clothes and no shoes, heavy belts, coats or full pockets with keys, change and mobile phones to achieve accuracy. 
Weight and height history should be plotted onto a centile chart. A picture of this can be built up from the parent and young person’s reports (possibly using estimated or reported weights), and will help to identify the speed of weight loss and over what time period, which may affect future goal setting and also help to understand their predicament and/or fears (especially if previous obesity is found to be a factor). This is an important visual tool for the parents to see exactly where they are versus where they need to get to. 
After the consultation you could contact their GP as often historical weights and heights are recorded and easily located on their electronic systems. Alternatively, access medical notes, weights and heights or lengths, even from a number of years previously can be useful when plotted on centile charts and match with parental reports, to build up a picture of the young person’s growth and weight history, including identification of any stunting or delayed pubertal growth as a result of the weight loss. 
Calculate estimated recent weight loss and compare to Junior Marsipan guidance for risk (26).
29 
Body Mass Index (BMI) 
The use of BMI is a valuable pointer to thinness but it is a poor reflector of the young person’s fat reserves. Furthermore, changes in BMI are not a reliable indicator of a change in body fat or muscle mass in this age group (27) and the effect of growth needs to be taken into account. However, it is worth taking into consideration where the young person weight has fallen from and to identify speed of weight loss and weight loss history. 
Additional consideration must be sought for the young person who is athletic and competing at high levels in sport, as they may have a BMI within the healthy range as a result of lean tissue. However, the assumed healthy BMI may not correlate with blood pressure and heart rate. Therefore, once again the percentage weight loss should be taken into consideration (28, 29). 
Percentage BMI (%mBMI) is useful, does not require a chart to understand progress and calculates to a similar value as to % weight for height. However, %mBMI displays similar downfalls to BMI in regards to some ethnic groups (e.g. Asian young people) which may well be overrepresented in the underweight category. If there is reliable evidence from child health records that that an individual has a height or BMI consistently above or below the 50th centile before anorexia nervosa developing then the target weight may need to be adjusted. 
% BMI = (actual BMI/median BMI for age and gender) x 100 
A percentage BMI calculator is available online at www.marsipan.org.uk. Falsifying Weight 
Be aware of fake gains – below are common ways by which this can be achieved – or at least by which the young person may believe they can be achieved: 
- Weights in clothes or pockets e.g. metallic change, anything smallish and heavy, rolls of coins taped into underwear, placed in socks or bras. 
- Wearing baggy clothes with many thin layers underneath. 
- Trying to be weighed in heavy shoes, hoping no one prompts them to be removed. 
- Wearing heavy jewelry 
- Wearing hair in a bun – check if hair is wet or for overuse of pins. Make sure nothing is hidden within the bun. 
- Drinking a lot of water before the appointment (1Litre = 1kg) 
- Eating salty food the day before – to help retain water weight 
- Eating any food they feel bloats them. 
- Eating a large meal - weight-heavy, not necessarily calorie heavy - maybe an hour or more before appointment.  
Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) is a simple and effective additional anthropometric measure; its use can eliminate some of the methods employed by young people with eating disorders to mislead practitioners about their true weight, such as water loading and attaching weights to various parts of the body (30, 31)
30 
Nutrition 
Acquiring an accurate diet history from young people with an eating disorder is complicated by the intentional over and underestimation of intake, so it is essential to have input from families along with a 3-day food record (taken or verified by parents). Nutritional assessment should expand on the history of food restriction and other self-imposed nutritional ‘rules’ such as exclusion of a food group (fats and/or carbohydrates); vegetarianism/veganism; daily calorie limits; ritualistic behaviours; a limit to the number of spoonful’s of food the young person will allow themselves to eat each day. Additionally, when reviewing young people with binge eating tendencies the dietitian will need to ascertain: 
- What the young person deems a binge to be. 
- If there is a specific binge food/food group. 
- Specific binge time. 
- Cyclical pattern to binges; when meals are missed – loss of control when eats again. 
Exercise routines should form part of the nutritional assessment and be taken into account when estimating nutritional requirements. An in-depth nutritional assessment also allows the dietitian to gauge the extent of the young person’s nutritional knowledge. 
Diet history 
A full dietary history taken by a dietitian is a useful tool to assess a young person’s current dietary intake, nutritional inadequacies in terms of calories and protein (32) but also micronutrients such as iron and calcium assessable on first glance. This justification can then form the basis and rationale to a young person for the need of change to eating behaviours and restore nutrition (33). A thorough documentation can also be an important tool to other multi-disciplinary team members working with the young person; they may not realise the difference between individual types of restriction and how they differ between young people and thus be useful in other therapy aspects, when understanding belief further down the treatment process. 
A detailed diet history should establish if the young person is avoiding red meat, fried food, dairy (high fat) or carbohydrates, or simply counting calories while eating what they like but exercising excessively. Furthermore, a diet history may extract anorexic ‘rules’ such as; not eating after 4pm; only eating with a particular utensil; chewing food a specific number of times before swallowing. 
A diet history will include what they are eating now - it’s important to establish what was offered or planned versus what was actually consumed. Don’t assume the packed lunch taken to school was eaten, ask the actual question – how much of this did you eat? If the answer is only part of it ask about whether the rest was discarded? 
The diet history should then go on to clarify what was being eaten in the past, such as 3 months, 6 months and 12 months ago, to identify change over time. Identifying the pattern or types of food cut out and over what time period this had occurred; this will aid you later in the treatment when the time comes to reintroduce forgotten or feared foods.
31 
Furthermore, the dietitian may be able to correlate specific times of weight loss to specific changes in intake. The changes may either be obvious or ones that seemed innocent at the time, which parents now retrospectively identify as being symptoms of AN, for example: 
- stopping snacks 
- becoming vegetarian 
- avoiding wheat/ diary as they cause bloating 
- refusing puddings 
- Skipping breakfast 
- Walking the dog 3-4 x day 
- Checking food labels – for example for a school project 
The dietitian should ascertain if the young person counts calories and/or grams of fat, and enquire into their understanding of what a calorie is and what, if any, limits they impose on themselves on a daily basis. It is important to clarify any food restrictions noticed as a result of this diet history or any in addition. These could include long standing and recent changes and the history of them is important to identify, these include: 
Key questions to consider 
- Cultural and family beliefs, including beliefs about fasting/food exclusions. 
- Likes and dislikes before and after the eating disorder started. 
- Foods eaten or avoided, such as high fat, high carbohydrate, processed foods or foods only in a packet which have calorie content on the side. 
- Medical condition/allergies requiring special diet – when diagnosed and how? 
- Vegetarian and vegan tendencies. 
- Eating patterns and routines, such as only eating between 4pm and 7pm or never eating after 8pm or never eating breakfast. 
- Other diet knowledge/beliefs – e.g. Atkins, low glycaemic index (GI), milk free, wheat free, blood type, clean diet. 
- Any other paternal/maternal/carer opinion on food/diet that is relevant to the young person’s predicament. 
- Eating with family or in isolation, and location - bedroom/outside/elsewhere. 
- Noticeably fast or slow eating 
- Other odd habits – eating with teaspoon, cutting food into tiny portions, adding excessive amounts of vinegar/other condiments to food.
32 
- Any other ritualistic behaviour. 
- Bathroom visits straight after or during a meal. 
Diet history and fluid intake 
An essential component of the nutritional intake is to estimate how much the young person drinks in the day and compare this to average requirements. This can vary widely between young people and the assessment should identify total volume, frequency and timings (34). This helps identify if large volumes are drunk before a meal, points to the risks of over hydration, and can raise suspicions about the young person abusing fluid as an aid to avoid eating or avoid hunger or aid vomiting. Similarly, some young people restrict fluid out of a fear of feeling full; most patients with AN equate the feeling of fullness with “feeling fat” (35). 
The type of fluid should also be considered: 
- High caffeine content - such as coke and coffee act as an appetite suppressant 
- Energy drinks, are high in caffeine but may also be taken to overcome fatigue related to excessive exercising or combat fatigue associated with a hypo-metabolic state (energy conservation). 
- Sweeteners/ Sugar free - laxative effect. 
- Alcohol consumption and indication for B vitamins supplementation (Department of Health, 1991). 
Hydration status assessment is recommended for those fluid restricting and a feature as part the of Junior Marsipan guidance of risk and admission requirement. 
Competencies: 
- Develop an understanding of how issues of under-reporting can be reduced in eating disorder patients when taking a diet history by asking specific questions about food intake i.e. ask if they use a fat spread on their toast rather than assuming that they do.  
- Be aware of the various computer programmes that offer on-line dietary reporting in the adolescent population. 
Validity of the diet history 
Under reporting of food intake is more common among overweight and obese individuals and makes it harder to obtain an accurate dietary intake. It is not clear whether under-reporting is specific to certain macronutrients or food generally despite studies been carried out on this subject (36). Some studies have shown that carbohydrate is under reported and protein is over reported. A logical explanation for this is that food items that have a negative health image such as sugary and fatty foods are more likely to be under reported. Whereas, those with a positive healthy image such as fruit and vegetables are more likely to be over reported (36). However, we need to be aware that these conclusions cannot be applied to young people with an eating disorder as they have not been studied. 
33 
However, in eating disorder patients we need to be mindful that both under and over reporting may be evident due to the motivational factors involved. In our society dieting is described as a national obsession which can drive overweight people to under report their food intake and is probably not a reflection of dishonesty.  
The gold standard for assessing food intake is a 7-day weighed food diary. However, various studies have shown that this type of data collection leads to weight loss due to a reduction in intake or a change in eating patterns. In one particular study the participants remarked that “…it would be a good way to make someone diet” after completing the study (37): This has obvious drawbacks to young people with eating disorders.  
The concern is that monitoring food intake may escalate the behaviours in AN and lead to further weight loss. On a practical level the only way to assess accurate food intake is to obtain oral intake in the form of self-reporting and self-monitoring basis. This is done by/can be achieved by people recording all the food and drink they consume prospectively (food diaries) or retrospectively (24 hr recall and food frequency questionnaires (38).  
Despite the fact that under reporting has been acknowledged for some time, little work has been done to understand this phenomenon. The following statement written over 20 years ago is still relevant today “… dietary intake cannot be estimated without error and probably never will” (37). One thing that is clear is that psychological factors play an important role in under reporting in obese individuals rather than a deliberate intention to falsify food records.  In terms of AN, we need to consider that this may play a more significant role than in the obese populations studied.  
It has been suggested that sufferers of AN include goal-directed behaviour as a reason for food restriction. However, this theory has been challenged, suggesting that there is an element of conditional habitual behaviour responsible for restriction rather than just cognitive restraint and disease-related manipulation (39). It is not clear from the results whether this applies to atypical patients with AN or those that engage in food restriction but are not low weight (40).  
Identifying Eating Behaviours (Family vs AN) 
Every family eats in a way that is unique to them and takes into account cultural background, family and peer influences; meal structure and routines are dependent on work and social routine. Family and friends can significantly and positively influence how someone eats; the presence of a parent at a meal is associated with improved eating (41, 42). 
Once a young person reaches their teenage years they typically eat in a less structured way than before, they snack more often and eat more convenient calorie dense snacks (43). Data also shows that 83% of adolescents consume at least one snack on any given day. Children currently snack almost three times per day, consuming more than 27% of their total daily calories mostly in the form of desserts and sweetened beverages (44). 
Young people with AN experience disruptions to normal eating routines when compared with their peers. Behaviours that relate to AN can be identified by working with their family to
34 
establish routines that are normal for the family and routines that the young person would have followed in the past. 
Deviation from previous and family routines aims to deliberately restrict food volume and/or focus on restricting food types that are perceived as ‘unhealthy’ or undesirable (45). 
Such maladaptive behaviours are a manifestation of AN related concerns and the young person’s anxiety about their weight or shape. Initially behaviour is goal orientated but it becomes habitual over time. A modification in the way a young person manages mealtimes may have several purposes: to prolong meal times; to create a diversion or distraction so that meals do not require completion; or to hide or conceal food to ultimately reduce the kilocalorie and fat content of food but also to reduce or manage distress and high levels of anxiety at meal times, (46). 
Eating behaviours in those with AN have been objectively assessed using diet histories and clinical studies of observed meals and food choices demonstrating a reduced total calorie and fat intake compared to those without AN (47, 48). Restrictive eating patterns reducing caloric intake, limited dietary variety and preference for consumption of foods of low energy density are related to poor outcome over time (46, 49). 
Food restriction has been termed ‘all consuming, relentless and remarkably stereotyped’ (50). The stereotyped nature of behaviours are characteristic of AN. 
Commonly reported examples of food manipulation are listed below: 
Avoidance behaviours: 
- Chop/ shred food into small pieces 
- Hide undesired food under other foodstuffs 
- Hide food under table, napkin or other item 
- Feed a family pet in a covert way 
- Feed a sibling or encourage a sibling to hide or eat food for them 
- Changing the daily routine to avoid mealtimes, such as making arrangements to meet friends, stay at friends’ houses, settings tasks to coincide with mealtimes 
- Studying for prolonged periods of time 
- Complaining of illness e.g. tummy bugs 
- Complaining that food smells off or deliberate spoiling of food, for example by leaving it out of the fridge to go off; spilling drink on to food; salt spillage. 
(51) 
Ways of reducing the kilocalorie content of meals: 
- Rubbing butter/spreads onto plate or hands
35 
- Overcooking food for example letting toast get burnt, then not eating it. - Undercooking food or leaving food to get cold 
- Reheating food multiple times 
- Crumbling food so that some food is left 
- Pushing food around the plate to make it look as though it is being eaten Increasing kilo calorie expenditure: 
- Choosing highly spiced foods 
- Adding chilli to meals 
- Over-salting food 
Creating a diversion or distraction so that meals don’t have to be completed: - Throwing food 
- Picking arguments through a meal and being deliberately confrontational at mealtimes Ways to attempt to minimise distress: 
- Checking nutritional content of foods 
- Choosing foods with clear food labelling 
- Watching or inspecting food being prepared and cooked 
- ritualised behaviours
36 
Biochemical Monitoring 
The initial consultation should include a detailed laboratory assessment to rule out any organic cause of weight loss and to obtain baseline biochemistry. Biochemical monitoring for young people at risk of refeeding syndrome can be found in the refeeding section. Specific nutritional markers that should be monitored include vitamin B12, folate, zinc, fat soluble vitamins A, D and E, and ferritin (52). In addition, manganese and cholesterol are recommended (53). Although blood markers do contribute to the overall medical picture, results can be a poor reflection of medical condition even in very unwell patients and should be viewed in the context of overall risk assessment (54, 55). A detailed assessment of biochemical markers can be found in table 5.  
Electrolytes 
Electrolyte disturbances may result from purging behaviours (vomiting, laxative abuse, or diuretic use), with hypokalaemia and hypophosphatemia being the most common (29).  Hypokalaemia is generally found only with significant purging (55). Serum phosphate levels do not reflect total body phosphorous and are therefore often normal in the starved state.  Hypophosphataemia is associated with refeeding and is typically the earliest biochemical change during this process. Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia are also known biochemical responses to refeeding (54). Table 5 outlines changes in biochemistry related to purging and Table 6 outlines biochemical parameters in AN. 
Acid base disturbance 
Hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis is seen with vomiting or diuretic abuse or chronic diarrhoea from laxative abuse and is likely to be associated with hypokalaemia.  Hypokalaemic hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis is seen with laxative abuse, due to loss of potassium and bicarbonate in the faeces (29, 54). 
Table 5: Electrolyte and acid-base changes associated with purging (56) 
Salt and water balance 
Hyponatraemia is commonly the result of water loading but may also be due to the misuse of diuretics or excessive sodium loss due to vomiting/laxative abuse. Medical causes include underlying sepsis, SIADH and Addisons disease. Management is dependent on the cause, so if there is any doubt about aetiology, a full medical assessment is warranted (26, 54). 
Renal function 
Urea and creatinine are typically low due to reduced protein intake and loss of muscle mass.  However, urea may also be raised in this picture due to catabolism, with a raised creatinine if there is significant muscle breakdown. Urea and creatinine at the higher end of the normal range may also be indicative of dehydration and/ or renal impairment (54). Raised levels require medical assessment of hydration status, as assuming dehydration could trigger unwarranted and possibly harmful fluid replacement intervention (26)
37 
Serum proteins 
Serum albumin is typically normal even in severe underweight. Hypoalbuminaemia may indicate occult infection, renal losses, liver dysfunction or enteropathy. Hypoalbuminaemia is associated with poor prognosis (54, 55). In cases of hypoalbuminemia, it is important to correct serum calcium level using standard formulae (55). 
Liver Function Tests 
Abnormal liver enzymes are common and are usually without symptoms and self-limiting.  However, in rare cases liver failure can occur. Elevated LFTs can occur as a result of starvation but are also seen during the refeeding process – the cause is unknown and tends to be temporary, improving with a more favourable nutritional status (54). 
Haematology 
Changes in the total blood cell count are regularly observed in AN patients with almost one third presenting with anaemia or leukocytopenia, while thrombocytopenia is less common at 5-10%. Anaemia presents with normal MCV, MCH, ferritin, folic acid and vitamin B12, while leukocytopenia is characterised by lymphocytopenia or neutropenia. Mild leukocytopenia as seen in AN is more frequent in AN-restrictors rather than in those who purge (36% versus 10%), and there is no significant evidence to suggest an associated infection risk. Severe neutropenia is uncommon (57).  
The severity of anaemia or other hematologic complications may be underestimated due to haemo-concentration as a result of purging behaviours. Morphological changes in the bone marrow, including atrophy of cells and gelatinous bone marrow transformation, are seen in a subset of patients who present with changes to total blood count. Serum iron and ferritin levels tend to be normal in AN due to reduced blood volume, and additionally females experience reduced iron losses due to secondary amenorrhoea. However, an elevated ferritin which normalises after refeeding may be seen, possibly due to the restoration of blood volume with weight regain. All haematological and morphological complications associated with AN disappear rapidly with nutritional repletion (57). Weight loss and pancytopenia should elicit concern and haematological malignancy should be considered as a differential diagnosis (55). 
Vitamin B12 
A recent study suggests that above normal vitamin B12 levels seen in malnourished adolescents with AN (outside of dietary supplementation) may be indicative of preclinical liver dysfunction (58). Deficient levels on the other hand are reversed with supplementation (29).

Table 6: Laboratory Parameters to consider in AN


Low abnormalities 
High abnormalities 
Comment
Phosphate 
(PO42-)
Low PO4 occurs due to 
vomiting and diarrhea, 
malnutrition, malabsorption, refeeding syndrome or 
continued infusion of high glucose solution in a 
nondiabetic 
patient
Phosphate levels can be elevated due to a variety of 
conditions, most notably kidney dysfunction, fractures 
in the healing stage, Addison’s disease (which can mimic 
bulimia and therefore needs to be ruled out), excess 
vitamin D
Phosphorous deficiency is life threatening. Serum levels may drop rapidly in malnutrition.  Any fall in phosphate must be treated urgently. 
Calcium(Ca2+) 
Low Ca can occur due to 
alkalosis, malnutrition, 
hyperphosphatemia due to laxative misuse. Increased Mg and PO4 intake (e.g. in 
supplementation) and excess use of laxatives can lower blood 
Ca++ level due to excess intestinal loss of calcium (ADA 2011). Refractory hypocalcaemia may be due to 
hypophosphataemia or 
hypomagnesaemia
Hypercalcemia is seen in 
prolonged use of diuretics, 
hiazides, 
excessive vitamin D, milk-alkali syndrome, 
hyperparathyroidism, cancer, Addison’s disease, 
hyperthyroidism, Paget’s disease, bone fractures w/bed rest (ADA 2011)
If serum albumin is ↓, serum calcium measurement will be low. Correct using standard formula (Hudson + O’Connor 2015). 
Hypocalcaemia increases risk of arrhythmia. Hypocalcaemia <1.1 mmol/l can lead to tetany, 
stridor, seizures, weakness, atrioventricular (AV) block, a prolonged QTc, arrhythmias and a risk of sudden 
unexpected death(JM 2012).
Potassium (K+) 
Hypokalemia is seen in 
malnutrition, malabsorption, vomiting, diarrhea, excess sweating (can be seen with excessive exercise), The most common cause of low K is gastrointestinal loss due to purging behaviors(ADA 2011).  Occsionally hypokalaemia seen with misuse of diruetics (Winston 2012) Hypokalaemia with metabolic alkalosis suggests SIV. Hypokalaemia with 
acidosis suggests possibility of laxative misuseJM 2012.
Hyperkalaemia is seen in 
Addison’s disease, which should be ruled out if eating disorders are suspected. Dehydration from fluid restriction and uncontrolled 
diabetes elevates K+.ADA 2011
A K+ value of less than 3.0 mmol/l merits admission to a paediatric unit and intravenous K+ correction(JM 2012). 
Measurement of urinary K may help to distinguish vomiting (in which urinary K is increased) from laxative misuse (in which it is reduced) (Winston 2012)
Magnesium 
(Mg2+)
Low Mg levels are seen in states where excess loss of fluids occurs such as diarrhea, diuretic use or misuse, 
protracted vomiting (ADA 2011) Hypomagnesaemia can occur before or during refeeding (Winston 2012). IV rehydration can precipitate hypomagnesemia.
↑with dehydration (ADA 2011) 
Serum Mg2+ levels can be normal when there is a 
deficiency (ADA 2011).  
Hypomagnesaemia = ↑risk of arrhythmia1. Hypomagnesemia may be associated with 
hypokalaemia, in which case Mg replacement is required before low K can be corrected (Winston 2012).
Urea 
↓ due to decreased protein intake and loss of muscle mass
Catabolism with severe 
malnutrition . May indicate 
dehydration and /or renal 
compromise with raised urea





39 
Creatinine 
↓ due to decreased protein intake and loss of muscle mass
May indicate dehydration and /or renal compromise with raised urea  May occur if there is significant muscle breakdown


Sodium (Na+) 
↓ due to water loading, 
excessive sodium loss due to diarrhoea/ vomiting or 
iatrogenesis sepsis, SIADH, diuretic use 
Addison’s Disease
Dehydration 
In general, plasma Na+is a poor indicator of total body Na+, and urinary electrolytes should be checked. Hyponatraemia in context of dehydration/ 
hypovolaemia will exacerbate hypokalaemia.
Chloride (Cl-) 
Chloride is lost from the 
gastrointestinal tract with 
purging behaviors such as vomiting which results in lower blood levels. Blood chloride is also lower with water loading/ Intoxication (
Can be increased (or decreased) with laxative abuse


Bicarbonate 
(CO2)
Bicarbonate can be low with laxative use, but can also be raised with laxatives (
Can be increased with vomiting and diuretics. Can be increased or decreased with laxatives


Albumin 
Hypoalbuminaemia may 
indicate occult infection, renal losses, liver dysfunction or enteropathy

Serum albumin is typically normal even in severe 
underweight.  
Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor prognosis 
In cases of hypoalbuminemia, correct serum calcium level using standard formulae
Liver function 
tests


Elevated LFTs may be starvation induced (and normalize with 
refeeding) or refeeding induced
Minor or even moderate 
abnormalities of liver function should not delay increased feeding
Cholesterol 


Elevated levels are relatively common with malnutrition 
and do not need dietary 
manipulation. Cholesterol levels resolve with weight restoration but may require a year. 
Lipids may raise with binge eating (


Amylase 


Raised amylase may prove a clue to concealed vomiting but normal amylase does not exclude it
Distinguish between high 
amylase due to pancreatitis (which can occur during 
refeeding process) and high amylase of salivary origin by measuring serum lipase

Glucose 
Hypoglycaemia secondary to lack of glucose precursors in the diet or low glycogen stores.  Hypoglycaemia is a common finding in AN however, severe hypoglycaemia is a grave prognostic sign and an 
indication for immediate 
hospitalization (Winston 2012) Hypoglycaemia may occur during refeeding due to 
excessive insulin response (‘dumping’) ( Winston 2012)
Hypervlycaemia may develop during refeeding particularly with enteral feeding employed.
Bingeing and purging can cause glucose levels to fluctuate widely.

(5, 58, 59) 
Note: for all parameters there are numerous other disease states that can affect levels.  These are the common reasons seen in eating disorders.  
Competencies 
- Identify what and when specific nutritional bloods should be monitored. 
- Identify an understanding of the common biochemical abnormalities seen in ED. For example: water loading; anaemia and purging behaviours 
Calculating energy requirements 
Energy requirements vary considerably throughout the course/ treatment of AN due to: normal increments associated with age/ height; changes in percentage body fat; and varying activity levels. Healthy adolescents have very high energy requirements because of the demands of the pubertal growth phase. However, low weight adolescents with AN have reduced energy requirements because their depleted body fat stores have led to an increase in cardiac vagal tone, causing bradycardia and hypotention, all of which aid conservation of energy (60). 
This altered metabolic state observed in low weight adolescents with AN supports the need for a graded incremental meal plan, outlined in Table 7. Initially, the aim is to stop weight loss and build a relationship with the family by devising a realistic achievable meal plan which encourages the young person to engage with treatment. Once weight loss has slowed and the patient has been able to adhere to the meal plan then energy intake can increase to a weight gaining meal plan. 
It is essential to ascertain whether the patient is at risk of the refeeding syndrome prior to commencing this graded meal plan. Please refer to the refeeding section for a detailed assessment and intervention for refeeding high risk patients.
41 
Table 7: Graded up meal plan for a 15years old female accounting for hypometabolic state of low weight Estimated energy intake on assessment 900kcal/ day 

Estimated Average Requirements: Height age (EAR) 
Estimated energy requirements: hypo metabolic (BMR)

Meal plan – 1 1500kcal/ day Day 1-3: halt weight losing trajectory 
Meal plan - 2 1800kcal/ day Day 3-7: weight gaining Meal plan - 3 2000kcal/ day Week 2+: continual weight gain 
Meal plan - 4 2500kcal/ day Week 7+ established energy requirements for age and height 
Energy requirements are driven by % body fat and total body weights therefore as weight increases so will energy requirements. If weight stabilises it may be due to this as opposed to compensatory behaviors.

Meal Planning 
The overarching aim of FT-AN is to empower the parents, build their confidence to feed their child. The parents’ confidence will determine how prescriptive the meal plan needs to be. The majority of families will only require guidance on portion sizes of main meals and the importance of incorporating snacks and fluids. However, some parents may feel disempowered and require a prescriptive meal plan which minimises the opportunity for manipulation. Table 9 outlines a prescriptive meal plan. 
A recent food diary should guide you when devising a new meal plan which should be: 
- Clear, concise and comprehensive 
- Initially devoid of ‘feared foods’ – these will be challenged later 
- Avoiding anorexic language – i.e. discussion of calories and grams - Transparent – build trust: if you are aware that parents are secretly adding calories to meal plan then this should stop. 
- As the weeks progress you would expect the parents to lead on changes to the meal plan with the guidance of the dietitian and therapist. 
Meal boundaries and support 
It is essential for the dietitian to gather a thorough understanding of family mealtimes (the Who, Where, When, What and How), so that they have an “idea of the way meals go in the family and where there are obstacles to renourishment, and have an understanding of the ways these issues may contribute to maintaining (or overcoming) the illness” .
42 
Key questions include: 
- Who is responsible for which elements of mealtimes (planning, shopping, preparing, portioning)? 
- How has the structure and process of meals changed with the development of the eating disorder (e.g. family eating schedule)? 
- What is the variety and energy density of food provided? 
- How do the parents respond to their child’s refusal? 
(20) 
The dietitian serves as a guide for families in relation to how to manage the barriers to renourishment and navigate the path toward normal eating, which may be difficult to recognise by a family affected by AN. Over time, parents / carers may have developed a reflexive habit of negotiation, which is often exacerbated by their child’s restrictive food preferences and “healthy eating” rules. The goal here would be to help them accept that, at its core, AN is irrational and negotiation is counterproductive (19).  
It is helpful to enquire about parental alignment so that the dietitian can identify any challenges and support parents in understanding how differences here impact the refeeding process; e.g. by asking the parents / carers questions such as: 
- Where do they differ in their view of refeeding and styles? 
- Do they acknowledge these differences, work them out together or become entangled in conflict? 
- How do they work together in other contexts? 
- What new strategies/ skills are they trying?  
- Where do they need to focus their efforts moving forward? 
(20) 
It is important for the dietitian to understand areas of parental divide - for example, one parent / carer worrying about their child’s distress while another is focused on dietary intake - in order to increase a sense of shared parental power and effectiveness. Throughout phase 1 the dietitian should suggest adjustments or strategies to meet the young person’s evolving nutritional needs. The parents/carers should be assisted in understanding the need for an increased frequency of meals, increased portions, increased caloric density, and consistent meals. Reminding families that food is their child’s medicine can help reorient family members to the importance of consistent nutrition as a means of recovery (19) 
If meals are not completed or left unfinished, dietitians can also assist parents / carers in understanding how to adjust subsequent meals or use nutritional supplementation (19). Helping the parents / carers reorient to what their child liked or enjoyed before the eating disorder assists them in externalising around food choices (20). 
The demands of feeding cannot be underestimated; mealtimes can appear to be ever constant, involving the young person to have three meals and two to three snacks daily. It is often necessary to help the parents / carers manage troubleshoot the need for almost continuous
43 
meal preparation, and understand the difference between feeding enough to support recovery and what might be considered ‘normal’ eating for child. Parents may have to delegate responsibilities to each other. They may also need assistance to meet the needs of other family members (19). 
The focus around meal times is to try and make the environment safe, predictable, and as calming as possible for all family members. 
Points that may be helpful: 
- It is vital that the family remain aware of the influence of the eating disorder, especially around meal times when the young person can be experiencing overwhelming feelings of anxiety. It can be helpful to plan ahead, for example, knowing who is going to eat with the young person and what is going to be eaten. Some thought should also be given to consistency and the importance of adhering to a routine, together with an agreement on the duration of the meal or snack. Time limits can help minimise eating disorder behaviours. For example, main meals 30-45 minutes, snacks 15 minutes. 
- Parents can find it helpful to discuss their expectations with the young person with support from the dietitian. 
- It is important for the dietitian to identify irrational beliefs or myths around nutrition which could contribute to maintaining the illness. Dysfunctional thoughts about eating should not be criticised as they are an expression of the eating problem. Parents or carers should encourage their child to eat without being influenced by the eating disorder and encourage parents to identify solution -based actions. 
- Behaviours around food intake and rituals to control eating - e.g. eating too slowly or too fast, separating fat and sauce from food, drinking a lot during meals, hiding food, cutting food into small pieces - should be gently interrupted. Support the family to work with the young person to challenge anorexic behaviours. 
- The dietitian should also model the kind of language they want the family to use. Family members should avoid criticism or threats e.g. “Eat for us, aren’t you ashamed about making us so sad?”, “You are killing us with your behaviour. You are so cruel.” “We have made a lot of sacrifices for you. The least you can do is eat this meal.” In difficult situations during meals, empathy should be reinforced, through supportive phases such as, “We know that the process towards recovery is hard, but we are here to help you. Try to do the right thing despite these thoughts.” 
It can be helpful to set some ground rules with the family and young person. The following is a summary from a patient involvement group asking young people with eating disorders what they want at the (table 8) (with permission from the Highfield Unit, Oxford):
44 
Table 8: What young people want at the dinner table? 
Avoid negotiation Negotiation around anything food orientated leads to an escalation of the “anorexic voice”. 
Don’t give up or give in Young people want to know that no matter how far they push you, you will hold the boundaries. 
Always be clear and consistent Any hesitation makes the young person feel the need to push boundaries even further. They want 
you to be firm, no matter how far they push you. 
Be vigilant If they notice you are not paying attention to what is happening at the table, the urge to hide 
food becomes overwhelming. This makes the 
next meal harder. 
Always encourage, do not threaten Verbal prompts you can use: “try and make a start”, “keep going.” 
Conversation General conversation is a great way to distract the young person. Even repeating things such as 
“pick up your fork” if someone is struggling. 
They want you to treat every meal or break at the 
table as a fresh start. 
Avoid the words “like” or “want” Try not to say things like “Would you like orange or apple juice?” or “Do you want 
cornflakes or Weetabix?” Just give a straight 
choice “Orange or apple juice?” 
Positives not negatives Young people stated that they find positive statements more helpful than negative ones. For 
example, “Try hard not to mash your peas” is 
more helpful than “Don’t mash your peas”. 

Encourage the smaller voice that holds thoughts of the future 
Positive things such as placemats or prompt cards can be helpful. 

Check how to praise and acknowledge the effort Some young people find it very distressing to be told they have done well. It is okay to find out 
the young person’s belief and ensure that praise 
is given accordingly. E.g. “I acknowledge that 
this meal was tricky for you and that it took a 
huge effort”.
45 
Meal supervision 
Meals and snacks should be provided under supervision ideally by someone who can demonstrate empathy and understanding, while setting firm boundaries about what is expected, i.e. how much is to be consumed in a set period of time (62). It is essential that appropriate observations are in place at mealtimes, i.e. consideration is given to who is present at each snack and mealtime, for overseeing the consumption of food and fluid and time limits for snacks and meals. Time limits for eating, e.g. 15 minutes per snack and 30 minutes per meal, all need to be agreed. Support and supervision are recommended for one hour after each meal and have been shown to reduce the need for nasogastric feeding (62). Additionally, meal supervision is a good opportunity to explore and discuss normal hunger and feelings of satiety. 
Any actions to be taken if a meal is not completed need to be agreed and documented in advance, e.g. the volume of supplement to be given to compensate for the incomplete meal. Individual circumstances will help to dictate the exact needs of the young person and any help that may be needed with respect to helping them eat the required amount of food. 
Post Meal Support 
Typically, after a meal, young people can experience intense feelings of conflict and guilt and be more at risk of compensatory behaviours such as purging or over exercising. ‘Riding the wave’ is an expression often used to relate to the fear and anxiety associated with the distressing feeling of satiety immediately post meal, which invariably subsides within 30- 60mins. It may be useful to think about bathroom use before a meal rather than directly after meals. 
To help overcome this ‘wave of anxiety’ the young person and their families can participate in a seated activity for 45 minutes post meals. Activities involving hand and eye coordination along with concentration such as jigsaws/ playing cards/ board games or knitting/crochet have been identified as the best distraction activities for people with eating disorders when preoccupied about eating (63). Thinking ahead with the young person and asking them what distractions may be preferred can be useful (64). 
Use of Oral Nutritional supplements (ONS) 
High energy sip feeds can be an invaluable weapon in the dietetic armory for the young person who is struggling to meet the large quantity of food required for the growing adolescent. A top up supplement can provide a nutrient rich addition, used as an adjunct to the meal plan, given after meals or snacks. However, there is a very limited research base for the use of ONS in the treatment of young people with AN. 
High energy and protein supplements available include Fortini Compact multi Fibre; Fortisip Compact (240kcal/ 100ml)/ Ensure 2kcal; Fortisip 2kcal (200kcal/ 100ml) / Pro-cal shot (334kcal/ 100ml). There are different ways of using ONS but the lack of any real literature on this subject leads to dietitians making clinical judgements on a case by case basis. Ideally patients should be encouraged to restore weight using food, but supplements are sometimes necessary to help with this.(26)
46 
When to use: 
ONS can be a useful way of increasing nutritional intake as they provide a means of giving a calorie, protein and micronutrient dense food to young people who are struggling with dietary intake; especially in adolescents who have high nutritional requirements for growth and development in addition to catch up growth. ONS should be considered when patients fail to restore weight through a food first approach.  
The time frame for introducing ONS should be taken on a case by case basis based on clinical risk, progress against expected weight restoration and progress with improving dietary intake.  Some patients may require them following initial dietetic assessment but for others they may not be required until later into treatment. 
ONS should be introduced in a timely manner collaboratively with the young person and their family, fitting supplements around their food intake, meal pattern and eating behaviours. 
Consideration of type of supplements to use: 
When commencing ONS consideration needs to be made regarding religious beliefs and patient’s wishes over vegetarianism. The companies producing the nutritional supplements can provide information on suitable products for these needs. 
Consideration should be given to the patient’s energy and protein requirements, risk of developing refeeding syndrome, present food intake, bowel habits, preferences and meal pattern when deciding which ONS to use, and how often they should be given. 
ONS that are nutritionally complete should be used in the first instance. The decision whether to use high energy supplements (such as Ensure TwoCal and Fortisip Compact) or supplements with a greater volume (such as Fortisip Bottle or Ensure Plus) should be made on an individual basis, depending on the patient’s preferences and current food and fluid intake. 
Consideration should be given to the physical health of the patient and whether a supplement with a lower osmolality may be better tolerated if the patient suffers with gastro intestinal symptoms. Clinical judgment should be made as to whether these symptoms are a physical result of taking the supplement or anorexia attempting to manipulate nutritional intake. 
It is not recommended to use a solely carbohydrate based supplement or juice based sip feed (which are high in carbohydrate) due to the possible increased risk of complications associated with refeeding. These supplements will also not contribute to correcting the possible deficiency in essential fats and fat soluble vitamins. 
The use of high calorie/high protein “shot” supplements (e.g. Calogen extra shot or Procal shot) can be used but these are not nutritionally complete and any micronutrient deficiencies in the dietary intake needs to be considered. It is not advised to use these supplements when food intake is very poor. 
Powder based ONS that are made up with milk in the home are not advised as a first line supplement due to risk of tampering by the young person during preparation. However, these can be used if other supplements are not tolerated. The family should be advised not to allow the young person to prepare these and that they should be taken when supervised to prevent the supplement being tampered with.
47 
Monitoring and discontinuing ONS: 
The young person’s compliance with taking supplements must be closely monitored by the dietitian. 
ONS should be slowly reduced as the patient’s weight improves. The ONS should be replaced by an increase in dietary intake to ensure adequate nutritional intake continues. 
The dietitian should remain fully involved with the patient and family until ONS are discontinued, expected weight gain has continued or weight has been maintained in line with normal growth and development (depending where the patient is in weight restoration) and adequate food intake has been fully restored. 
Competences: 
- The dietitian is able to assess nutritional intake and risk factors to make a rational clinical decision to use supplements 
- The dietitian should be able to choose the appropriate ONS for the patient and advise on use. 
- The dietitian should be able to monitor use of ONS and make a plan to safely discontinue.

Phase 2 - Returning control over eating to the young person This phase of treatment focuses on encouraging the parents to help their child to take more control over eating again in an age appropriate manner  
During this second phase it is important to expand on the importance of a balanced diet with particular focus on bone health. This needs to be age appropriate with caution around giving too much nutritional information to the younger patients who may not have developed an extensive/ inappropriate understanding of calories/ fat etc. Furthermore, this phase should be used to ascertain whether the family and young person understand their nutritional needs to optimise catch up growth and healthy development. 
Taking Control of Eating 
Positive signs that eating is becoming easier include eating to appetite, serving larger portions and having additional snacks not included on the meal plan. Once parents and the therapy team agree that there is a significant shift in the young person’s attitude towards eating, then a ‘food and feeling diary’ can be trialed. 
Table 10 gives an example of how to promote return of eating to the young person. For example, at breakfast the parents noted down that a sufficient amount of food was served by the young person and therefore no suggestion/ addition needed. However, at dinner time the parents felt that an insufficient amount of food was served and therefore suggested another two roast potatoes; what was actually managed was one roast potato. The point here is that, if there are consistent shortfalls in expected intake, and regular battles, it may be that the young person does not have a grasp of what is expected or is not ready/ capable of taking control of the AN. A ‘feeling section’ can be added which can be kept private or discussed with family/ individual therapist.

Challenging Feared/ forgotten foods 
Half a banana (an appropriate negotiation) 

It is during this second phase of FT-AN that challenging the young person’s ‘feared foods’ can start. The dietitian has an important role in helping to identify when excluded food is leading to nutritional deficiencies in the diet. There are a number of tools to help young people introduce foods into their diet. Parents should be encouraged to maintain variety in the young person’s food intake. Work should be done collaboratively with the family as they will know the young person’s food preferences and dislikes prior to the illness and they know their child best. This history may need to go back several years prior to any eating disorder behaviour becoming apparent. 
The eating disorder team can provide help and support to the family in maintaining a good variety of food intake and challenge feared foods at the best time in treatment. There is a lack of evidence on the best way to introduce “feared” foods and challenging the patient to increase the range of foods in their diet. There is evidence to suggest that maintaining the range of foods that a person with AN will eat can give a better outcome on recovery. (59)
51 
Food hierarchy 
This can be performed in a number of ways including, the reintroduction of foods that were most recently excluded, in a sequential manner, gradually increasing the number of foods eaten. Alternatively, a list of feared foods can be formulated, which is usually completed with parents in conjunction with the young person as it is a difficult task for them, and essential to have trust between all parties. The idea is to gradually introduce the least feared food and work up the list over a defined period of time. It is important to be observant that there is not an increase in compensatory behaviors (i.e. exercise) to counterbalance the addition of feared foods and that if there is, ensure it is time limited.

Food Variety Hierarchy 
This can be used to help guide the clinician, young person and their family to improve the variety of food they have (Table 11). It can be repeated over time to help the young person recognise improvements that have taken place through treatment. The dietitian should start with the least ‘scary’ food, or the foods most recently excluded, and discuss how it can be incorporated into a family meal; this may simply involve just touching/ tasting food. It is important to continue with regular exposure to feared foods to help with reducing anxiety.

Behavioural experiments: 
Challenging fear foods and setting up behavioural experiments around this need to be done alongside other members of the multi-disciplinary team to ensure that any experimentation is done in a safe manner. Appropriate training should be sought by the dietitian if not confident in this area. 
There are various help sheets available on the internet that can help the dietitian to work with the young person to identify and challenge their thoughts and belief around food.

Competencies 
- The dietitian will be able to assess the young person’s diet to identify the need to introduce fear foods. 
- The dietitian will be trained and confident to use suitable CBT techniques to challenge and help the young person to carry out behavioural experiments around this.

Exercise and activity Level 
Exercise and activity level is a contentious issue in young people with AN who have previously used exercise to control their weight or shape. It is important to remember that healthy exercising has many benefits not least its cathartic value. Studies are ambiguous about exercise in eating disorders especially in AN and some suggest that exercise can have a positive anxiolytic and depression-reducing effect (65). Additional benefits also includes: strengthening of muscles, management of mood and improved bone health (66-68). 
It is well known that sufferers of eating disorder use unhealthy amounts of exercise as a form to lose weight and that they are driven by negative thoughts about themselves rather than the enjoyment of exercise and increase in wellbeing (69). However, another reason for this urge to exercise can be found in the brain (70) . Patients with AN lose the ability to experience normal pleasure and tend to avoid rewarding outcomes, most profoundly in food intake. As a result they will probably exercise longer/more intensely in order to achieve the same pleasure (71, 72); this is often referred to as ‘compulsive exercise’ (73). 
Once the team has deemed exercise to be safe based on: cardiovascular health, bone mineral density and %mBMI >85%, then low level activity can be introduced. The recommended guideline for exercise is one hour per day. This may include walking to and from school (20mins/ day) or partaking in PE at school. Table 12 outlines expected the energy expenditure from a variety of different activities with worked examples how to calculate. 
Table 12: Exercise energy requirements (EER) 
Exercise/activity Duration/intensity EER = EAR x (PAL x time spent) 
Seated jiggling/swinging legs 4 hours/day EAR x (1.4 x 4/24) Walking/jogging 2 hours/day EAR x (1.8 x 2/24) 

Competitive training (gymnastics/ dance/swimming) 
High intensity 2 hours/day EAR x (2.4 x 2/24) 

EAR, estimated energy requirement for energy (SACN); PAL, physical activity level. 
Worked examples: 
A 10 year old girl spends 5 hours seated jiggling per day. EER = 1935 kcal (8090 kJ) x (1.4 x 5/24) = 564 kcal (2360 kJ) 
Total daily energy requirements = 1935 kcal (8090 kJ) (EAR) + 564 kcal (2360 kJ) (EER) = 2500 kcal (10.45 MJ) 
A 7 year old boy spends 2 hours jogging per day. EER = 1650 kcal (6895 kJ) x (1.8 x 2/24) = 250 kcal (1035 kJ) Total daily energy requirements = 1650 kcal (6895 kJ) (EAR) + 250 kcal (1045 kJ) (EER) = 1900 kcal (7940 kJ) 
A 14 year old girl spends 2 hours swimming per day and 1 hour jogging. EER = 2340 kcal (9780 kJ) x ([2.4 x 2/24] + 2340 kcal (9780 kJ) x ([1.8 x 1/24]) = 545kcal (2275 kJ) 
Total daily energy requirements = 2340 kcal (9780 kJ) (EAR) + 545 kcal (2275 kJ) = 2885 kcal (12.10 MJ)
54 
Someone struggling with an eating disorder is known to be likely to have a drive to exercise more than the general population and as mentioned above, it is likely that exercise will have to be prescribed or managed for some time (74). It is important to explain to patients that precautions are put in place in their best interest, to reduce the risk of weight loss or injury, both of which could result in no exercise or only limited activity being allowed. It is also important to realise that removing this responsibility from the young person who is forced by their illness to over-exercise can come as a relief to them. 
Once the young person has demonstrated that they can continue to gain weight whilst performing low level activity and managing additional snacks to account for the increased energy level then it is viable to consider starting out of school clubs. However, it is important to avoid solitary sports such as running and swimming which inadvertently promote rigidity (counting lengths/ laps) or sports that emphasise body shape (gymnastic/ dance/ ballet). It is better to encourage team sports which have a social component (hockey/ football/ netball). 
Suitable snacks for 30mins of moderate exercise are outlined in Table 13 which also accounts for the raised energy expenditure that occurs post-exercise. Furthermore, appropriate snacking can also help the young person to feel better in themselves by avoiding excessive post exercise exhaustion. Taking part in exercise will mean having more to eat. Eating snacks after exercise will not affect weight unless it is part of increasing muscle tone. After exercise the body will use the additional nutrition in the following ways (75): 
- Repair caused to muscle during exercise 
- Reduce muscle soreness 
- Protect the immune system 
- Increase muscle quality 
- Improve recovery 
- Improve overall performance 
Table 13: Suitable snacks for 30mins of moderate exercise = 200-300kcal per snack 
Cereal bar – nut base 
Banana and toast sandwich

50g Mixed nuts

Smoothies 
Hummus or falafel wrap 
Flapjacks –oats and grains



Any exercise limitations should be reasonable and clinically defensible. That is why the type, intensity and duration of exercise as well as energy intake are extremely important and caution needs to be taken (Table 14). Re-introducing exercise can encourage a person struggling with an eating disorder to continue their recovery, collaboratively. However, once exercise limits are set, they should be adhered to, so as to build confidence and trust between
55 
the treatment team and family. If the young person struggles to consume the additional calories post exercise then the snack should be eaten prior to exercise to avoid this confrontation. Be mindful of excessive exercising or other compensatory behaviours to counteract additional snacks.

Additional points to consider when introducing healthy exercise: 
- Having a responsible professional to manage the exercise can be a relief for the young person and parents 
- Healthy exercise behaviours should be introduced for those who are progressing through treatment and are clinically stable 
- Exercise should be personalised according to the physical and mental status of each patient 
- Energy replacements are recommend accordingly to calories burned
56 
Phase 3 - Exploring and creating a life outside an eating disorder and establishing a healthy adolescent identity 
This phase is usually initiated once the adolescent is able to maintain a healthy weight (3 regular menses or if pre-menarche/ male > 95%mBMI) and focusing on establishing a healthy age-appropriate relationship with parents. 
This can be the most rewarding phase for clinicians, young person and family as it is a time when control of their AN becomes noticeable and should be encouraged and challenged in a controlled and guided manner – it is important not to push too hard even if the young person wants to move faster. 
During this phase you can challenge rigid calorie counting by recommending eating out at new restaurants without calling ahead and checking the menu; or by advising the young person to buy new products/ brands without checking calories.  
Normal adolescent behaviour versus AN behaviour 
Adolescence is a time when many physical and biological changes occur. Hormonal changes during puberty impact on/affect mood, behaviour, sleep patterns and the desire to take risks with decreased awareness of consequences and an increased stress level. Physical changes occur in the brain which impact on their emotions and their ability to understand others. There is a strong need for independence and wanting to separate from the family; friendships become a stronger influence as they try to establish themselves in society with an independent identity (76). 
Adolescence is therefore normally a time of transitions and of learning new coping strategies as your people struggle to cope with all the changes they are faced with. These years are often a time of experimentation with socialisation, partying, relationships, trying out different patterns of eating, fashion, looks, alcohol and drugs while making new friends and facing academic and other challenges (77). 
When an adolescent is struggling with an eating disorder there is a risk that growth and development is delayed/ stunted due to lack of nutrition. AN often makes the young person socially isolated and peer relationships do not develop.  
The FT-AN approach places parents in control, which further limits the normal adolescent development. Parents’ can be encouraged to support age appropriate adolescent independence away from eating and meals if the young person continues to rely primarily on parents regarding food choices. Be mindful that parents’ may feel socially isolated and lose sight of what normal adolescent development is and what the young person’s peers are doing. 
Once eating issues/ weight concerns are no longer the primary concern, families need to be encouraged to deal with age appropriate decisions around negotiating adolescent issues which include education, socialising, exercising, flexible thinking and risk taking. The role for the team/ therapist/ dietitian is not to make those decisions but to support the family to make age appropriate decisions by encouraging communication and modelling problem solving techniques. 
The dietitian could be involved in thinking about meals out of the home, social events that involve food and alcohol, dealing with trips away from the family, cooking independently
57 
vegetarianism and planning for future issues. It is useful to help parents distinguish between adolescent and anorexic thinking around/ concerning food, eating patterns and alcohol. 
In light of the low self-esteem which often accompanies AN it is essential to address the risks of alcohol and drug misuse; coping strategies and healthy general recommendations might need to be discussed with emphasis on risky behaviour associate with adolescents with AN. 
Strategies to do this 
The forming of a these strategy needs to be family lead and, as these issues form part of the wider treatment package there is no definite advice, rather these issues need to be thought about with the care team involved. 
Useful questions to consider include: 
- What used to be normal in your family / what have older siblings done? - What are negotiable & non-negotiable rules within your family/ home? 
It can be helpful to ask families to consider what resources they have; this could include encouraging them to talk to other parents with similar aged adolescents (without an AN)  
Competencies: 
- To understand how adolescent development affects the young person, parents & other family members 
- To be able to discuss in a MDT meetings setting how these considerations are discussed with the family & who is taking the lead role in these discussions  
Healthy growth in adolescents and weight maintenance 
In the absence of an evidence-based methodology or best practice guidelines on how to calculate expected body weight (EBW), pinpointing when a patient is fully weight restored is not as straight forward as getting them to 100% weight for height (78). The range from the 50th to the 91st BMI centile is large (79) and many young people are very anxious to know how far into that range they will be required to go before they are allowed to switch to a plan that aims to maintain their weight. Post treatment weight trends are suggested to continue to be low for most patients diagnosed with AN in adolescents (although not in BN/BED), and clinicians should resist the pressure to initiate weight maintenance prematurely (80). 
When to initiate weight maintenance 
In young people pre-morbid weight centile may be a good indicator of their individual trajectory. This can often be obtained from the NCMP data if there is no other record available. This information however should not be regarded in isolation and the following factors should also be assessed: 
- Is the young person able to eat in an unrestricted manner to appetite? - Is the young person able to eat a balanced healthy diet including all food groups in appropriate amounts to sustain adolescent growth? 
- Is the young person able to consume energy dense foods and eat out socially with appropriate regularity? 
- Is there evidence of age appropriate pubertal development (menstruation)? - Does the young person continue to have any malnutrition related physical symptoms?
58 
- Is the young person able to undertake physical activity in line with current recommendations and maintain body weight? 
If the answer to any of the questions above is ‘No’, the patient should be encouraged to shift the focus from weight to achieving the above behavioural goals. 
Healthy growth in adolescents 
It is important for young people and their families to understand that adolescent growth, and therefore weight increase, does not discontinue until around age 20. In fact, from the ages of 13 to 18, weight and height increase rapidly, especially during the earlier years, provided nutritional provisions are adequate (Table 15) adapted from UK RCPCH (2012).

Adapted from the UK RCPCH Growth Charts (2012) 
Self- weighing 
Current evidence on the usefulness of regular self-weighing is conflicting with relatively few studies applicable to adolescents with eating disorders. A recent meta-analysis suggested that it had a positive impact on weight management in healthy adults without an increase in disordered eating (10), whilst another literature review highlighted negative psychological outcomes (81). Friend’s (2012) study in adolescents failed to find any associations between effective weight management and self-weighing, but found self-weighing to be related to potentially harmful weight control behaviours (82). Another study within this age group echoed the outcomes of adult studies (81), that more frequent weight monitoring was associated with increased severity of eating disorder behaviours in females (83). 
59 
Young people recovering from an eating disorder are likely to find an increasing weight trend anxiety provoking, yet from the growth charts it is clear, that this is to be expected and clinicians should resist the pressure to commit to a rigid EBW. In conjunction with this and in light of the above evidence, self-weighing should not be recommended for those recovering from AN and realistic expectations should be discussed with the patient and the family using the growth charts. 
Competencies 
- Demonstrates understanding of normal adolescent growth rate 
- Be able to assess if weight maintenance phase is appropriate to commence - Understand the associated risks of alcohol and drug misuse, and self-esteem 
Balance of Good Health 
Eating in a balanced way is vitally important in restoring physical health as the journey of recovery continues from an eating disorder. The aim of nutrition, broadly speaking, in recovery is to supply the body with sufficient energy from protein, carbohydrates and fat to replenish and rebuild depleted body tissue. However, it is important to get the balance right. 
Eatwell Guide 
For the general population The Eatwell Guide is a valuable tool to educate about the principles and importance of a balanced diet. The Eatwell Guide (2016) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide  
However, concerns have been raised over the Eatwell Guide and its impact on psychoeducation for patients recovering from eating disorders (http://www.dietitiansmentalhealthgroup.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Statement-on the-use-of-the-Eatwell-Plate-in-Eating-Disorders.pdf). Previously, dietitians who work in the field of eating disorders were using the Eatwell Plate as an educational tool to explain and justify a healthy balance of macronutrients and micronutrients within a normal healthy diet in the UK. 
The new plate has removed the “high fat/high sugar foods”, and the guidance clearly says that these foods are not required in a healthy diet. However, this is not applicable to eating disorders patients as these foods need to be part of their diet. The new guide also includes recommendations regarding calorie quantities. Counting calories is not recommended for young people with AN and not everyone should be on the same calorie intake for weight restoration. 
The previous Eatwell Plate was used as a framework to explain dietary balance; however, the new version has its flaws in the field of eating disorders. It can be used to help patients
60 
recognise that their individual needs for health may sit outside the recommendations for the general public and must be interpreted for individual needs. 
Carbohydrates 
Carbohydrates are our primary source of energy. Once digested, they break down into glucose, which is the body’s basic fuel. Glucose is carried around the body by the blood and delivered to every cell in the body to provide energy. After a meal some glucose is used immediately as fuel but some is stored in the muscles and liver in the form of glycogen to be used later for fuel. 
The human brain burns 500 to 600 calories per day, which is provided by glucose. The human brain cannot store glucose, which means it is vital to have a regular intake of carbohydrates throughout the day. If eating is restricted or delayed then symptoms of tiredness, low mood, poor concentration and a decrease in cognitive ability may result. Sleep disturbances are also often experienced. 
UK recommendations for carbohydrates intake is 50-55% of total dietary intake. Around a third of our plate at each meal should be made up of foods high in carbohydrates e.g. bread, potatoes, rice, pasta and cereals. 
Fats 
Fats are distributed in all body cells and fulfil a wide range of structural, metabolic and storage functions in the human body. 
Why do we need fat? 
- Energy source: fats are oxidised to provide energy and are the most concentrated form of dietary energy. 
- Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat soluble: We need an adequate intake of fat in our diet to provide us with these essential vitamins. 
- Essential fatty acids: these are obtained through food as the human body cannot synthesise them. Omega 3 and omega 6 are the essential fatty acids our body requires. They play an important role in brain function, preventing heart disease, supporting many functions of the body and are a vital part of our body’s makeup. 
- Fatty acids provide a protective layer around essential organs and bones to protect from impacts and to insulate the body. 
- Saturated fats: are involved in the body’s immune system and in the functioning of hormones. 
UK recommendations are that up to 35% of our total energy intake should be derived from fats. For example, on a 2000 calories diet, about 700 calories would be supplied by fat. Ideally, aim to eat more foods that contain the essential fatty acids such as nuts, seeds, olives, oily fish, sunflower oil and olive oil.
61 
Essential Fatty Acids 
Omega 3 Fatty acid is a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). They contain some of the essential fatty acids, so called because the human body cannot make them without getting these fats from the diet. The omega 3 fats are ALA (Alpha Linolenic Acid) DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenic acid). 
- ALA cannot be made in the body so must be eaten in the diet. It has important functions and is needed to make other omega 3 fats. It is found in vegetable oils, rapeseed and linseed (flaxseed), nuts (walnuts, pecans and hazelnuts) and green leafy vegetables. 
- DHA and EPA are long chain fats that can be made in the body from ALA. These have the most direct health benefits and they are found in oily fish 
- The body can make DHA and EPA but slowly and in small amounts. The most effective way to get enough DHA and EPA is to eat foods rich in these fats. Fish and especially oily fish are good sources. 
We need these fats because they are part of all the cells in are bodies, particularly the retina (eye), brain and sperm, and they are used to form eicosanoids which have an important function in lots of the body’s systems such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune and endocrine.  
DHA and EPA (Most useful source of Omega 3s) 
- Mackerel, Trout, Crab (fresh), Kippers, Sprats, Whitebait, Pilchard, Salmon, Swordfish, Tuna( fresh or frozen), Herring, Sardines 
ALA (food source) 
- Vegetable oils, Rapeseed oil, Flaxseeds, Chia seeds, Walnuts, Pecans, Hazelnuts. 
There are no recommendations in the UK for a dose of omega 3. Sufficient DHA and EPA can be obtained by taking 2 portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily. 
If fish is not eaten then ALA can be taken to make DHA and EPA in the body but there is no recommended amount and the body may not make enough to meet its needs. 
Competencies 
- Understand the types and function of Omega 3 fats 
- Understand how much is needed 
- Understand why fats are an essential part of a balanced diet
62 
Protein 
Protein is needed for growth and repair of body tissue and plays an important role in the healthy functioning of the body. Following a period of malnutrition, adequate protein intake is essential to restore weight and physical health. UK recommendations for protein intake are 10-15% of our total daily calorie intake. 
Amino acids form the building blocks of protein and the essential amino acids cannot be synthesised by the body therefore they need to be consumed from dietary sources. Good sources of protein include meat, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy products, pulses, nuts and quinoa. A variety of animal and plant protein is recommended to ensure different amino acids are supplied. Protein foods are also important sources of other nutrients such as iron, B vitamins, zinc, magnesium and omega 3 all of which are essential for physical health. 
An adequate protein intake can also assist with psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Tryptophan, one of the essential amino acids, is a precursor of serotonin a neurotransmitter which is involved in mood regulation. Tryptophan is present in most protein rich foods and therefore it is recommended to include some protein at each meal. 
Iron 
There is limited evidence for the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in young people with AN and the reported incidence of anaemia varies considerably between studies (84, 85). In studying the general population the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2016) found that nearly half of all British girls (age 11-18) studied had an iron intake below the lower reference nutrient intake (LNRI). This was in contrast to 9% of boys (86). 
Serum ferritin level is the biochemical test which most reliably correlates with relative total body iron stores. A normal ferritin level is not sufficient to rule out iron deficiency due to the impact of infection, inflammation and hydration have on ferritin levels. Evidence shows that ferritin is often elevated in young females with amenorrhoea and AN due to muscle catabolism, masking iron deficiency. As a result of amenorrhoea iron loss is reduced, therefore clients most at risk of iron deficiency anaemia are those who continue to menstruate or for whom menstruation has resumed (53). Iron deficiency anaemia can impact on mental and motor development in children therefore it is important to ensure an adequate iron intake throughout the 3 phases of FT-AN. Ensuring adequate iron intake is particularly important for female clients who are menstruating. 
Excessive iron intake from supplements can cause toxicity. For children 20mg/kg of elemental iron can lead to symptoms of toxicity. Iron overload from food is not usually a risk, therefore it is preferable to meet iron requirements with food rather than supplements. However, if a young person has iron deficiency anaemia, dietary changes alone are not enough to correct this and supplements should be used (5). 
It is difficult to accurately determine iron absorption because of the impact of other nutrients and the body’s ability to enhance absorption in times of deficiency and inhibit absorption in times of overload. Dietary enhancers and inhibitors of iron are outlined in Table 16 (87). Haem iron is the most easily absorbed form and is derived from animal based sources. Often for young people with AN, rich sources of iron e.g. red meat are avoided due to fear of their high saturated fat content. Iron can be obtained from plant based sources (non-haem iron); however this is not as easily absorbed. For this reason young people following a vegetarian/vegan diet may need higher iron intakes or encouraged to have vitamin C with
63 
and/ or after meals to enhance non-haem iron absorption. Unfortunately, there is no data quantifying amount (87). 
Table 16. Dietary enhancers and inhibitors of iron (8)

Parents and young people should be educated about the different types of iron, good sources of iron (table 17) and the role of other nutrients in iron absorption. 
Definition of Iron deficiency anaemia: 
- A haemoglobin level below 12g/100ml in males aged 12-14 years and non-pregnant females over age 12 
- Haemoglobin level below 13g/100ml in males over 15 years old 
(88) 
If a young person is diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia they should be referred for further investigations to rule out non dietary causes. Individuals diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia should be screened for coeliac disease. Referral for further investigations should not delay treatment and young people should be started on an iron supplement (88) 
The first line treatment for young people over 12 years old is ferrous sulphate alongside dietary advice (Table 17). Ferrous sulphate is recommended because of its high bioavailability and cost effectiveness. Side effects are common and are dose related therefore it is advised to start on 2 tablets daily and increase to 3 if tolerated. If ferrous sulphate is not tolerated alternatives are listed below. Ferrous gluconate tablets, which contains less elemental iron, they may be better tolerated.

Fluid 
As a major constituent of every body cell, water is essential for life and has many functions. It is involved in transporting nutrients to cells and removing waste products for excretion; it aids digestion and absorption and helps to regulate body temperature. 
Drinking enough is vital to maintain good health in the short and long term. Dehydration can occur within 12hrs leading to tiredness, headaches and dizziness. The colour of urine is the best indicator of hydration. In the UK drinks provide 70-80% of our fluid requirements with the remaining 20-30% coming from food sources. The recommended amount of fluid taken as drinks for children 9-13 yrs is 1.5L and for those over 14 yrs is 1.6L for females and 2.0L for males. This can come from water or in the form of juice, squash, milk or hot drinks which also provide valuable calories and nutrients when in recovery of AN. 
Vegetarianism and veganism 
Vegetarianism and veganism are becoming increasingly popular within the UK diet, especially amongst adolescent girls. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of 4- 18y old females found that 10% of girls aged 15-18yrs reported being either vegetarian or vegan (89). 
The link between patients with an eating disorder and those who adopt a vegetarian diet is well established (90). It has been reported that up to 52% of parents presenting with AN are also vegetarian. The NHS estimates that ~2% of the UK population follow a vegetarian diet (NHS Choices, 2017).  
There are a number of types of vegetarian diets ranging from: 
- Semi-vegetarian where an individual will occasionally eat meat or fish - Pesco-vegetarian where an individual will exclude meat and poultry but will eat fish - Lacto-ovo vegetarian where an individual will exclude all flesh foods but include dairy and eggs 
- Ovo-vegetarian where an individual will exclude all flesh foods and dairy but include eggs in their diet 
- Lacto-vegetarian where an individual will exclude all flesh foods and eggs but include dairy products in their diet 
British Nutrition Foundation, 2005 
Over the past few years clinicians working with patients with eating disorders have also noted a rise in the number of patients describing themselves as vegan although there is much less research into this area. Data from over 1000 patients identified that patients requiring in-patient treatment for their eating disorder presented with increased incidence of veganism, 11% in the case of adult in-patients and 16% of CAMH patients (Unpublished data – Fuller & Brown). The Vegan Society estimates that ~1% of the population of Great Britain follow a vegan diet - this growing trend is driven by younger females, living in urban areas making more ethical and compassionate choices (The Vegan Society, 2016). 
Eating a healthy balanced diet is important in maintaining physical health and reduces the risks of other illnesses or diseases later in life. A healthy balanced diet will therefore require an individual to eat a wide variety of foods, in the right proportions, to maintain an
68 
appropriate body weight where their body can function – in females a key marker of this is menarche. Furthermore, in children and adolescents their diet should provide enough nutrition to ensure that they grow in height and develop through puberty. 
Many patients may have adopted a socially acceptable dietary exclusion as part of the development of their eating disorder. In line with a FT-AN approach the dietitian should assess the family belief around this. It is the dietitians’ role to educate the family about the incidence of veganism within the general population and among patients presenting with an eating disorder, so they can fully understand the relevance of a restriction in their child’s diet.  If the family do not believe the restriction is linked to the onset of the eating disorder the dietitian should support the family in re-feeding their child within the potential restrictions of a vegetarian or vegan diet. 
Legal considerations protecting veganism  
Human Rights Law 
The European Convention on Human Rights Article 9 states that there is a right to “Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion” specifically: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (European Convention of Human Rights, 1950) 
The key point here is about the daily behaviours that accompany a person’s belief, which for vegans means not consuming anything of animal origin, using animal products or products tested on animals. 
The International Vegan Rights Alliance advises that any interference that limits a vegan’s practice may amount to coercion into a belief not of their choosing. The European Convention on Human Rights became part of UK law in 2000 as part of The Human Rights Act 1998.  
Veganism and UK Equality Law: 
Veganism is a protected characteristic, classified as a religion or belief under The Equality Act 2010 in England, Wales and Scotland. The Act outlaws direct and indirect discrimination, victimisation and harassment.  
The Vegan Society advises that in practice a vegan should be treated in the same way as you would treat a person with a specific religion, such as a Muslim, Christian or Jew. 
Children and Young Adults: 
Children and young adults are covered by the Equality Act 2010 and The Human Rights Act 1998 in the same way as adults. 
Additionally, the UN Convention on the Rights of The Child 1990 - which covers the rights of persons under 18 - underlines the right of children and young people to practice their religion or belief. There is also provision to support the: 'rights and duties of the parents and,
69 
when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. 
Vegetarian and Vegan dietetic assessment: 
Dietetic assessment of a patient following either a vegetarian or vegan diet should take into account the following: 
Common nutritional vulnerabilities of a vegetarian diet 
The UK Vegetarian Society recommends that a balanced vegetarian diet should include the following foods daily: 
- 3 to 4 servings of cereals/grains or potatoes 
- 4 or 5 servings of fruit and vegetables 
- 2 or 3 servings of pulses, nuts & seeds 
- 2 servings of milk, cheese, eggs or soya products – although nutritional requirements of adolescents will be higher 
- A small amount of vegetable oil and margarine or butter. 
- Some yeast extract such as Marmite, fortified with vitamin B12 
Common nutritional vulnerabilities of a vegan diet 
A vegan diet further restricts the number of foods available. A dietitian should be aware of the following nutritional vulnerabilities: 
- Calcium 
- Essential fatty acids 
- Iodine 
- Iron 
- Selenium 
- Vitamin B2 
- Vitamin B12 
- Vitamin D 
- Zinc 
Additionally, concise guidelines can be found on the British Dietetic Association’s Mental Health Group Page. 
Enteral and oral nutritional supplements 
To help people manage their prescribed calories a sip feed may be offered if they are  struggling either to eat a specific meal/snack, or finding the volume of food required  too difficult. Whilst the majority of sip feeds on the market are suitable for patients following a vegetarian diet, there are no nutritionally complete vegan ACBS approved sip feeds or enteral feed. However, it is worth noting that the very definition of veganism recognises that the avoidance of animal use is as far as possible and practicable. A vegan may be willing to use a sip feed if there is no other alternative, in the same way that many vegans use medications that are tested on animals or contain animal products. 
70 
If a patient is at risk of refeeding syndrome, both in-patient and out-patient eating disorder teams may prescribe a multi-vitamin and or specific mineral supplement e.g. phosphate depending on blood test results. Again, because of the way in which these products are manufactured none are suitable for vegans. However, this should be offered in line with local refeeding guidelines when it is necessary to provide life-saving treatment. 
Competencies 
- Demonstrates confidence in assessing current dietary intake 
- Identify if any nutritional supplementation is required 
- Educate family on the importance of a varied balanced diet in order to optimise nutritional intake  
Group sessions – During and after recovery 
Research suggests that characteristic abnormalities in eating behaviour persist following intensive and lengthy care and, as a consequence, re-hospitalisation rates remain high (48, 91). Inpatient and outpatient eating disorder treatment programmes typically provide guidance on establishing a varied and adequate diet in order to promote healthy weight restoration, and in some circumstances nutrition education is provided (92), albeit topics of education can and do vary. It is common for a person’s physical, psychological and social wellbeing to be remarkably affected by an eating disorder and therefore creating and managing a life after these challenging illnesses can be difficult. In light of this, it is postulated that dietetic lead group education can help to enhance patient autonomy re: food choices and support in exploring and creating a life after an eating disorder (93). 
Reduced costs and improved management of professional resources are some of the benefits group education offers. Group education also allows for peer support that would otherwise be unachievable for those participating in one-to-one dietetic counselling. Although the aforementioned are important benefits of group education, it must also be considered that for some individuals – shy or reluctant socialisers – the group environment is undoubtedly unsuitable (94). Additionally, it has also been documented that other worries related to anxiety associated with being in a group may cause some distress, for example concerns that “people will judge me” or comparative thinking towards other group members, e.g. thigh width or overall weight (93). 
There is no blueprint to dietetic-led psycho-education groups, however when the aim is to enhance patient autonomy and support in exploring and creating a life after an eating disorder, useful topics to consider may include: creating a new and more permissive and flexible manner regarding food and eating situations; enjoying a social life that includes and embraces food; development of skills, knowledge and confidence to shop for oneself, or even to help parents with shopping in a healthy and non-eating disorder manner; planning, preparing and even cooking healthy meals. A general guidance on the format of group education programmes can be seen below, with this level of intensity likely reflecting
71 
realistic implementation resource availability within the NHS (93). As with any dietetic intervention, key behaviour change strategies should underpin the programmes’ content. 
Example format of a group education programme: 
- Participants attend 3 x 90min weekly or fortnightly education sessions - Facilitated by dietitians in the service 
- Themed topics – topical - press/ news related; myths around nutrition; bone health; importance of essential fats 
- Run approx. 4-5 per year, however this will depend on demand 
- Participants are encouraged to bring a relative or friend with them, or if children parents must attend 
- Information sharing: not asked to share personal information 
- Informal approach 
- 4-6 participants 
Relatives/friends/parents are encouraged to participate in all the group activities.

Refeeding severely malnourished young people 
Although infrequent, and rarely critical, refeeding syndrome is a serious potential complication of commencing feeding in children and young people who have experienced starvation and should be considered and monitored for in such patients (95, 96). As starvation and malnutrition can occur for a large number of reasons in childhood and adolescence, it should be considered in all children irrespective of underlying condition or specialty. 
The refeeding syndrome is a physiological phenomenon driven by insulin resulting in deranged biochemistry which leads to cardiovascular abnormalities. During starvation, insulin concentrations decrease and glucagon levels rise in response to depleted glucose. Glucagon breaks down glycogen forming glucose, rapidly depleting muscle and liver glycogen stores (97). As glycogen stores are depleted, gluconeogenesis is activated utilising lipids and proteins as metabolic substrates to form glucose. However, gluconeogenesis has a limited capacity to support the body’s energy requirements. Therefore, during this period of low serum insulin, hormone sensitive lipase is activated and breaks down adipose tissue to form fatty acids and glycerol; the fatty acids are transported to the liver to be converted to ketones. Ketones now replace glucose as the body’s major energy source during acute starvation (98, 99). 
Complications manifest with the introduction of carbohydrates, triggering a metabolic sequence of events due to a switch from ketone to glucose metabolism. The subsequent insulin surge that occurs in response to rising serum glucose levels causes a rapid intracellular movement of glucose, fluid and electrolytes (100, 101). 
For most young people, the most significant finding will be a fall in serum phosphate. When undernourished patients are fed, there is an increased requirement for phosphate as the body switches back to carbohydrate metabolism, which can be potentiated by a background of relative phosphate depletion in starvation. Phosphate levels in the blood begin to fall, and cardiovascular and neurological sequelae may follow (26) 
The most important factor is anticipating and remaining vigilant for biochemical and clinical features of the refeeding syndrome, especially in the first 48 hours, and then the first five days of initiating feeding. Low phosphate levels will usually correct when treated with oral phosphate supplements, or given intravenously if the enteral supplement is not tolerated. 
Refeeding syndrome may occur up to two weeks after initiating feeding, so vigilance is needed for this period. Whilst it is important to be vigilant and re-feed safely, “underfeeding syndrome” i.e. weight loss or inadequate weight gain should also be avoided. 
At risk group 
Those young people with: 
- Very low weight (in particular those <70-80% weight for height/median Body Mass Index (BMI) (102) 
- Acute starvation with rapid weight loss prior to commencement of nutrition - Prolonged intravenous (IV) fluid therapy (devoid of glucose)/ fasting/ nil by mouth. 
- Previous history of refeeding syndrome. Electrolyte abnormalities prior to starting feeds. 
- Low white blood cell count (102)
73 
Important considerations prior to commencing feeding 
- Baseline bloods (see the section on biochemical monitoring below). 
- Start to correct electrolyte disturbances as feeding commences and consider prophylactic phosphate for those who have been known to have refeeding syndrome before 
- Consider an ECG according to the individual, especially where there is pre-existing cardiac arrhythmia (particularly prolonged QTc) 
- Prepare for strict monitoring of fluid balance 
Commencing nutrition 
The refeeding of malnourished young people needs to be gradual and closely monitored and must increase in controlled phases in order to avoid further weight loss, which has been termed ‘under-feeding syndrome’. 
Note that although initial feed rates provided here are for safe initiation of feeding; children and young people may well have additional requirements, e.g. for increased losses or catch up growth, which should be considered and incorporated into feeding plans after the safe commencement of nutrition, as per the protocols below. 
Adolescents pose a particular high risk in light of their high energy requirements. When coupled with restricted nutritional intake, this lends itself to a rapid deterioration in health. Table 20 outlines the refeeding phases that can be adopted to promote appropriate weight gain in a timely and safe manner. A worked example of a phased refeeding regimen is given in Table 21. Furthermore, Table 22 provides guidance for target energy requirements which takes into account the reduced activity along with the hypometabolic state associated related with malnutrition. 
Other considerations 
- Rehydration should ideally be done as part of the feeding regimen or corrected before to avoid fluid overload associated with refeeding. 
- Consider nasogastric (NG) tube insertion if daily energy requirement is not met orally with food and/ or nutritional supplements 
- Bolus NG feeds are preferable to continuous as they closely mimic normal physiology and reduce individuals’ preoccupation with energy. However, continuous feeds may be considered in those with hypoglycaemia, upper GI symptoms or malabsorption.

Table 20: Refeeding phases for adolescents at high risk of refeeding syndrome (102) Refeeding phase Target energy requirements and weight gain 

Primary Day 1-2 
Secondary Day 2-4 
Tertiary Day 7–14 
∙ Commence at 30-40 kcal (125-165 kJ)/kg/day  
∙ Increase by 200 kcal (840 kJ)/day until secondary refeeding phase reached ∙ Correct deranged electrolytes; do not stop refeeding 
∙ Weight loss/maintenance likely during this primary refeeding phase ∙ Consider oral thiamine 100-200 mg twice a day, continue for 10 days 
∙ Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) + Physical Activity Level (PAL) ∙ Maintain secondary refeeding phase if adequate weight gain (0.5-1.0 kg/week) 
∙ Once weight gain reduces, increase by 200-300 kcal (840-1255 kJ)/day until tertiary refeeding phase reached 
∙ Estimated average requirement (EAR) energy for height age ∙ Maintain tertiary phase if adequate weight gain (0.5-1.0 kg/week) 

Progression ∙ If sufficient weight gain not achieved with EAR continue to increase energy intake by 200-300 kcal (840-1255 kJ) every four days until weight increase 
of 0.5-1 kg/week 
Maintenance ∙ Once weight is >85% median BMI, weight gain can be slowed or maintained depending upon the therapeutic plan as discussed with the 
multidisciplinary team
75 
Table 21: Worked example of a phased refeeding regimen 
14 year old girl with anorexia nervosa, weight = 30kg. She is restricted to limited activity on the ward giving her a physical activity level (PAL) = 1.2. Her basal metabolic rate (BMR)* = 1223kcal (5112kJ). 
Day (refeeding phase) Target energy requirements and weight gain 
Day 1 and 2 (primary phase) It has not been possible to elicit an accurate reliable diet history 
Start a meal plan: at 40 kcal/(165 kJ)/kg = 1200 kcal 
(4950 kJ)/day 
Now calculate the secondary phase energy intake 
target: 
BMR x 1.2 PAL (restricted to ward) 
[(17.686 x 30 kg) + 692.6] x 1.2 PAL = 1468 kcal (6140 
kJ)/day 
Day 3 and 4 (secondary phase energy intake target) Increase meal plan by 200 kcal (820 kJ)/day until secondary phase requirements met 
= 1468 kcal (6140 kJ)/day 
Weight should increase as a result of hydration and 
glycogen store replenishment 
Now calculate the tertiary phase energy intake 
target: 
EAR for energy = 2342 kcal (9836 kJ) [26]. 
Day 7 (tertiary phase energy intake target) Increase meal plan by 200 kcal (820 kJ)/day until tertiary phase energy requirements met 
Halt energy increments and monitor weight gain 
From this point weight gain target: 0.6-1.0 kg/week (0.1 
kg/day). 
If weight gain is <0.6 kg/week, increase meal plan by 
300 kcal (1255 kJ) = 2650 kcal (11.07 MJ)/day 
Progression If sufficient weight gain is not achieved continue to increase energy intake by 300 kcal (1255 kJ) every four 
days until weight gain target of 0.6-1.0 kg/week (0.1 
kg/day) is achieved.

Monitoring for the refeeding syndrome 
The characteristic and most common finding in refeeding syndrome is hypophosphataemia which, if untreated, can lead to cardiovascular and neurological sequelae. Other electrolytes can also be affected including potassium, magnesium and sodium. 
Monitoring for clinical features is also important and must be responded to, especially fluid balance. Important clinical features to look for include: an unexplained resting tachycardia, oedema, confusion/ delirium or conscious level. 
Daily clinical and biochemical monitoring is required until full calories are achieved and the young person is stable. Table 23 outlines normal biochemical ranges for children. 
Nutritional monitoring 
- Nutritional monitoring (amount of calories/intake that is actually being received as well as changes in weight)/BMI) is an essential part of the management of refeeding syndrome to ensure that appropriate nutrition is being given and supplementation can take place. 
- Urinary sodium may be useful to determine sodium depletion. 
- Early weight gain will be secondary to hydration and glycogen replenishment. 
Clinical monitoring 
- Monitor frequently through the day for oedema or confusion. 
- In particular, identifying and reporting tachycardia to members of the medical team is important as this can be an early sign that refeeding syndrome is developing. 
Biochemical monitoring 
- Urea, creatinine (Cr), Sodium (Na), potassium (K), phosphate (PO), calcium (Ca), albumin and Magnesium (Mg) should be measured daily for 5 days (Table 22 for electrolytes where normal ranges are age dependent). 
- As refeeding can also occur for up to 2 weeks repeat electrolytes at day 10 and 14. - Abnormalities usually occur within the first 72 hours after commencing nutrition. - Measure blood sugars if a patient is symptomatically hypoglycaemic. 
- Consider measuring urine for osmolality, electrolytes, pH, glucose and protein in the first 5-10 days in those patients with blood or clinical signs of the refeeding syndrome. This should be discussed and considered with the senior medical team responsible for this child or young person.

Treatment of refeeding Hypophosphataemia 
- DO NOT increase feed regimen until phosphate corrected and normalised - Check vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) – optimise phosphate 
- Homeostasis daily monitoring of urea, creatinine, Sodium, Potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, albumin until phosphate normal. 
- Consider oral phosphate supplements for mildly low levels or intravenous phosphate supplements for significantly low levels of serum phosphate (e.g. <0.5 mmol/L), poor clinical status or where oral supplementation not possible/tolerable. 
- Always discuss with Consultant & inform Clinical Site Practitioners (CSP), dietitian and ward pharmacist. 
- Ensure peripheral IV access if no central IV access, particularly in those considered most at risk and those with other medical co-morbidities. Some children with mild hypophosphataemia who are otherwise clinically stable may not automatically need IV, but the decision should be based on likely risk and other medical problems, and should be decided by the medical team. 
- Repeat ECG if evidence of refeeding syndrome – monitor for QT interval prolongation 
- Phosphate <0.3mmol/L is considered severe and HDU/PICU support may be needed – should be discussed with consultant and CSP and PICU leads for the shift. 
Patient develops clinical features of the refeeding syndrome 
Clinical features include: 
- resting tachycardia 
- peripheral oedema 
- confusion/altered conscious level
79 
- Reduce energy to starting dosage; do not increase energy until serum phosphate levels normal and clinically stable. 
- Check FBC, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, calcium, LFTs, gas-correct any electrolyte, acid-base abnormalities. 
- Check blood sugar 
- Start cardiac monitoring. 
- Observations must include full PEWS/CEWS, lying/standing Blood Pressure and neuro-observations. 
Carbohydrates and the refeeding syndrome 
Despite low energy intakes in the secondary phase of refeeding, weight gain is often achieved due to the rapid replenishment of glycogen stores. However, the refeeding syndrome is driven by insulin and therefore the carbohydrate intake should not exceed the recommended amount of 60% of dietary energy (103). Most oral nutritional supplements and enteral feeds contain 42-46% energy from carbohydrates, regardless of whether they are standard or high energy formulas. However, the total energy load from high energy formulas is higher than that from standard formulas, which may have an overall deleterious effect (104). 
Overview 
FT-AN is the evidence based treatment model for young people with AN and therefore dietitians should be focusing their treatment programmes to align with FT-AN. It is important to appreciate changeable energy requirements and therefore regularly to recalculate energy requirements throughout the treatment period. 
A concise well-structured meal plan can provide parents with the confidence needed to engage with FT-AN, opening the opportunity to promote weight gain and avoid hospitalisation. Working in conjugation with the therapy team will guide the dietetic treatment, ensuring appropriate challenging of AN and optimising nutritional intake, while minimising the long term physical complications associated with AN.
